<P>

We could solve this using a daemon, but for the
sake of demonstrating a feature of <TT>thedark</TT> we won't.
In <TT>Initialise</TT>, write <TT>thedark.initial = GoMothGo;</TT>
and add the routine:
<PRE>
[ GoMothGo;
   if (moth in player)
   {   remove moth;
      "As your eyes try to adjust, you feel a ticklish sensation
       and hear a tiny fluttering sound.";
   }
];
</PRE>

<h2>&#167;13 &nbsp; Doors</h2>

<blockquote>The happiness of seizing one of these tall barriers to a room by the
porcelain knob of its belly; this quick hand-to-hand, during which
progress slows for a moment, your eye opens up and your whole body 
adapts to its new apartment.<br>
&#8212; Francis Ponge (1899&#8211;1988), <i>Les plaisirs de la porte</i></blockquote>

When is a <code>door</code> not a door? It might be a rope-bridge or a ladder,
for instance. Inform provides doors for any situation in which some
game object is intermediate between one place and another, and
might on occasion become a barrier. Doors have a good deal in
common with containers, in that they need to be open to allow access and 
to this end can also have <code>openable</code>, <code>lockable</code> 
or <code>locked</code>. Just as with containers, any key they have 
should be stored in the <code>with_key</code> property. The same
actions <code>Open</code>, <code>Close</code>, <code>Lock</code> 
and <code>Unlock</code> all apply to doors just as they apply to
containers. There are four steps in creating a new <code>door</code>:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;margin-left:30px">
<li>(1) &nbsp; give the object the <code>door</code> attribute;</li>
<li>(2) &nbsp; set its <code>door_to</code> property to the location on 
the other side;</li>
<li>(3) &nbsp; set its <code>door_dir</code> property to the direction which 
that would be, such as <code>n_to</code>;</li>
<li>(4) &nbsp; make the location's map connection in that direction point 
to the door itself.</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">For example, here is a closed and locked door, 
blocking the way into the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; Shrine:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object Corridor &quot;Stooped Corridor&quot;
  with description &quot;A low, square-cut corridor, running north to south,
           stooping you over.&quot;,
       n_to Square_Chamber,
       s_to StoneDoor;
Object -&gt; StoneDoor &quot;stone door&quot;
  with description &quot;It's just a big stone door.&quot;,
       name 'door' 'massive' 'big' 'stone' 'yellow',
       when_closed &quot;Passage south is barred by a massive door of
           yellow stone.&quot;,
       when_open &quot;The great yellow stone door to the south is open.&quot;,
       door_to Shrine,
       door_dir s_to,<a id="p133" name="p133"></a>
       with_key stone_key
  has  static door openable lockable locked;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Note that the door is <code>static</code> &#8211; 
otherwise the player could pick it up and walk away with it. 
(Experienced play-testers of Inform games try this every time,
and usually come away with a door or two.) The properties <code>when_closed</code> 
and <code>when_open</code> give descriptions appropriate for the door 
in these two states.</p>

<p class="indent">A door is ordinarily only present on one side of 
a map connection. If a door needs to be accessible, say openable or 
lockable, from either side, then the standard trick is to make it 
present in both locations using <code>found_in</code> and to fix the 
<code>door_to</code> and <code>door_dir</code> to be the right way 
round for whichever side the player is on. Here, then, is a two-way door:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; StoneDoor &quot;stone door&quot;
  with description &quot;It's just a big stone door.&quot;,
       name 'door' 'massive' 'big' 'stone' 'yellow',
       when_closed &quot;The passage is barred by a massive door
           of yellow stone.&quot;,
       when_open &quot;The great yellow stone door is open.&quot;,
       door_to [;
           if (self in Corridor) return Shrine; return Corridor;
       ],
       door_dir [;
           if (self in Shrine) return n_to; return s_to;
       ],
       with_key stone_key,
       found_in Corridor Shrine,
  has  static door openable lockable locked;
</pre>

<p class="normal">where <code>Corridor</code> has <code>s_to</code> set 
to <code>StoneDoor</code>, and <code>Shrine</code> has <code>n_to</code> 
set to <code>StoneDoor</code>. The door can now be opened, closed, entered, 
locked or unlocked from either side. We could also make <code>when_open</code> 
and <code>when_closed</code> into routines to print different descriptions 
of the door on each side.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Puzzles more interesting than lock-and-key involve 
writing some code to intervene when the player tries to pass through.
The interactive fiction literature has no shortage of doors which only 
a player with no possessions can pass through, for instance.</p>

<p class="indent">Care is required here because two different actions 
can make the player pass through the door. In the Corridor above, 
the player might type &#8220;s&#8221; or &#8220;go south&#8221;, 
causing the action <code>Go s_obj</code>. Or might &#8220;enter 
stone door&#8221; or &#8220;go through door&#8221;, causing <code>Enter 
StoneDoor</code>. Provided the door is actually open, 
<a id="p134" name="p134"></a>
the <code>Enter</code> 
action then looks at the door's <code>door_dir</code> property, finds 
that the door faces south and generates the action <code>Go s_obj</code>. 
Thus, <em>provided that the door is open</em>, the outcome is the 
same and you need only write code to trap the <code>Go</code> action.</p>

<p class="indent">A neater alternative is to make the <code>door_to</code> 
property a routine. If a <code>door_to</code> routine returns <code>false</code> 
instead of a room, then the player is told that the door &#8220;leads 
nowhere&#8221;, like the broken bridge of Avignon. If <code>door_to</code> 
returns <code>true</code>, then the library stops the action on the 
assumption that something has happened and the player has been told 
already.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans20">EXERCISE 20</a></b></span><br>
Create a plank bridge across a chasm, which collapses if the player 
walks across it while carrying anything.</p>

<a id="ex21" name="ex21"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans21">EXERCISE 21</a></b></span><br>
Create a locked door which turns out to be an immaterial illusion 
only when the player tries to walk through it in blind faith.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b> <b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
&#8216;Advent&#8217; is especially rich in two-way doors: the steel 
grate in the streambed, two bridges (one of crystal, the other of rickety 
wood) and a door with rusty hinges. See also the iron gate in 
&#8216;Balances&#8217;. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>The library extension <tt>&quot;doors.h&quot;</tt> 
by L. Ross Raszewski defines a class called <code>Connector</code> of 
two-way doors, which are slotted automatically into the map for convenience. 
Max Kalus's further extension <tt>&quot;doors2.h&quot;</tt> enables 
such doors to respond to, say, &#8220;the north door&#8221; from one 
side and &#8220;the south door&#8221; from the other.</p>

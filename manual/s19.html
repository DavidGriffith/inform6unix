Okay, there is light.<br>
&gt;<tt>examine the light</tt><br>
It is good.<br>

&#8212; from a transcript of &#8216;The Creation&#8217;, a game never 
written but proposed in some of Infocom's surviving documents.

shalts and begats and haths.&#8221;)</blockquote>

Sighted people observe whether it's light or dark so instantly that
the matter seems self-evident. The Inform library has to use reason
instead, and it rechecks this reasoning very frequently, because
almost any change in the world model can affect the light:</p>

<p class="output">a total eclipse of the sun;<br>
fusing all the lights in the house;<br>
your lamp going out;<br>
a dwarf stealing it and running away;<br>
dropping a lit match which you were seeing by;<br>
putting your lamp into an opaque box and shutting the lid;<br>
black smoke filling up the glass jar that the lamp is in;<br>
the dwarf with your lamp running back into your now-dark room.</p>

<p class="normal">The designer of an Inform game isn't allowed to tell the library &#8220;the player
is now in darkness&#8221;, because this would soon lead to inconsistencies. (If you
want it to be dark, ensure that there are no light sources nearby.) Because light
is automatically calculated, you can write statements like the following, and
leave the library to sort out the consequences:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
give lamp light;
remove match;
give glass_jar ~transparent;
move dwarf to Dark_Room;
</pre>

<a id="p155" name="p155"></a>
<p class="normal">The <code>light</code> attribute means that an object 
is giving off light, or that a room is currently lit, for instance 
because it is outdoors in day-time.</p>

<a id="ex40" name="ex40"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans40">EXERCISE 40</a></b></span><br>
Abolish darkness altogether, without having to give every location 
<code>light</code>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">When the player is in darkness, the current <code>location</code> 
becomes <code>thedark</code>, a special object which behaves like a 
room and has the short name &#8220;Darkness&#8221;. Instead, the 
variable <code>real_location</code> always contains the actual room 
occupied, regardless of the light level.</p>

<p class="indent">The designer can &#8220;customise&#8221; the darkness 
in a game by altering its <code>initial</code>, <code>description</code> 
or <code>short_name</code> properties. For example, the <code>Initialise</code>
routine of the game might include:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">thedark.short_name = &quot;Creepy, nasty darkness&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">See <a href="s20.html">&#167;20</a> for how
&#8216;Ruins&#8217; makes darkness menacing.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Light is reconsidered at the start of the game, 
after any movement of the player, after any change of player, and at 
the end of each turn regardless. The presence or absence of light 
affects the <code>Look</code>, <code>Search</code>, <code>LookUnder</code> 
and <code>Examine</code> actions, and, since this is a common puzzle, 
also the <code>Go</code> action: you can provide a routine called</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">DarkToDark()</pre>

<p class="normal">and if you do then it will be called when the player 
goes from one dark place to another. (It's called just before the 
room description for the new dark room, normally &#8220;Darkness&#8221;, 
is printed). You could then take the opportunity to kill the player 
off or extract some other forfeit. If you provide no such routine,
then the player can move about as freely in the darkness as in the light.</p>

<em>Darkness rules.</em> &nbsp;
Here is the full definition of &#8220;when there is light&#8221;. Remember
that the parent of the player object may not be a room: it may be, say, 
a red car whose parent is a large closed cardboard box whose parent 
is a room.</p>

<a id="p156" name="p156"></a>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(1) There is light exactly when the parent of the player 
&#8216;offers light&#8217;.</li>
<li>(2) An object is see-through if:
 <ul style="list-style-type:none">
 <li>(a) it is <code>transparent</code>, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(b) it is a <code>supporter</code>, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(c) it is a <code>container</code> which is <code>open</code>, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(d) it is <code>enterable</code> but not a <code>container</code>.</li>
 </ul></li>
<li>(3) An object offers light if:
 <ul style="list-style-type:none">
 <li>(a) it itself has the <code>light</code> attribute set, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(b) any of its immediate possessions have light, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(c) it is see-through and its parent offers light.</li></ul>
<li>(4) An object has light if:
 <ul style="list-style-type:none">
 <li>(a) it itself has the <code>light</code> attribute set, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(b) it is see-through and any of its immediate possessions have 
 light, <i>or</i></li>
 <li>(c) any object it places in scope using the property 
 <code>add_to_scope</code> has light.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<p class="aside">It may help to note that to &#8220;offer light&#8221; 
is to cast light inward, that is, down the object tree, whereas to 
&#8220;have light&#8221; is to cast light outward, that is, up the 
object tree. The library routines <code>IsSeeThrough(obj)</code>, 
<code>OffersLight(obj)</code> and <code>HasLightSource(obj)</code>
check conditions (2) to (4), returning <code>true</code> or 
<code>false</code> as appropriate.</p>

How would you design a troll who is afraid of the dark, and needs to 
be bribed with a light source&#8230; so that the troll will be as 
happy with a goldfish bowl containing a fluorescent jellyfish as 
he would be with a lamp?</p>

For a <code>DarkToDark</code> routine which discourages wandering about 
caves in the dark, see &#8216;Advent&#8217;. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>It is notoriously tricky to handle 
the gradual falling of night or a gradual change of visibility.

This rummage through special kinds of objects finishes up with the most
sophisticated kind: living ones.  Note that the finer points of this
section, on the arts of conversation, require some knowledge of Chapter
V.
<P>

Animate objects, such as sea monsters, mad aunts or nasty little dwarves,
have a property called <TT>life</TT>.  This behaves somewhat like a <TT>before</TT>
or <TT>after</TT> routine, but only applies to the following actions:
<P>

<DL>
<DT><B><TT>Attack</TT></B><DD>

The player is making hostile advances...
<P>
<DT><B><TT>Kiss</TT></B><DD>

...or excessively friendly ones...
<P>
<DT><B><TT>WakeOther</TT></B><DD>

...or simply trying to rouse the creature from sleep.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>ThrowAt</TT></B><DD>

The player asked to throw <TT>noun</TT> at the creature.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>Give</TT></B><DD>

The player asked to give <TT>noun</TT> to the creature...
<P>
<DT><B><TT>Show</TT></B><DD>

...or, tantalisingly, just to show it.
<P>
<DT><B><TT>Ask</TT></B><DD>

The player asked about something.  Just as with a "consult''
topic (see <A HREF="section15.html">Section 15</A> passim), the variables <TT>consult_from</TT>
and <TT>consult_words</TT> are set up to indicate which words the
object might like to think about.  (In addition, <TT>second</TT>
holds the dictionary value for the first word which isn't
<TT>'the'</TT>, but this is much cruder.)
<P>
<DT><B><TT>Tell</TT></B><DD>

Likewise, the player is trying to tell the creature about
something.  The topic is set up just as for <TT>Ask</TT> (that is,
<TT>consult_from</TT> and <TT>consult_words</TT> are set, and <TT>second</TT>
also holds the first interesting word).
<DT><B><TT>Answer</TT></B><DD>

This can happen in two ways.  One is if the player types "answer <I><B>&#60;some text&#62;</B></I>
to troll" or "say <I><B>&#60;some text&#62;</B></I> to troll''; the other is if he gives an
order which the parser can't sort out, such as
"troll, og south", and which the <TT>orders</TT> property hasn't handled
already.  Once again, variables are set as if it
were a "consult'' topic.  (In addition, <TT>noun</TT> is set to the
first word, and an attempt to read the text as a number is
stored in the variable <TT>special_number</TT>: for instance,
"computer, 143" will cause <TT>special_number</TT> to be set to
143.)
<P>
<DT><B><TT>Order</TT></B><DD>

This catches any 'orders' which aren't
handled by the <TT>orders</TT> property (see below); <TT>action</TT>,
<TT>noun</TT> and <TT>second</TT> are set up as usual. 
</DL>
<P>
 
If the <TT>life</TT> routine doesn't exist, or returns false, events take their
usual course.  <TT>life</TT> routines tend to be quite lengthy, even for
relatively static characters such as the priest who stands in
the 'Ruins' Shrine:
<PRE>
Object -&#62; priest "mummified priest"
  with name "mummified" "priest",
       description
          "He is desiccated and hangs together only by will-power.  Though
           his first language is presumably local Mayan, you have the curious
           instinct that he will understand your speech.",
       initial "Behind the slab, a mummified priest stands waiting, barely
           alive at best, impossibly venerable.",
       life
       [; Answer: "The priest coughs, and almost falls apart.";
          Ask:     switch(second)
                   {   'dictionary', 'book':
                            if (dictionary has general)
                                "~The ~bird~ glyph... very funny.~";
                           "~A dictionary? Really?~";
                       'glyph', 'glyphs', 'mayan', 'dialect':
                           "~In our culture, the Priests are ever literate.~";
                       'king', 'tomb', 'shrine', 'temple', 'altar', 'slab':
                           "~The King (life! prosperity! happiness!) is buried
                            deep under this Shrine, where you will never go.~";
                   }
                   "~You must find your own answer.~";
          Tell:   "The priest has no interest in your sordid life.";
          Attack, Kiss:  remove self;
                  "The priest desiccates away into dust until nothing
                   remains, not a breeze nor a bone.";
          ThrowAt: move noun to location; &#60;&#60;Attack self&#62;&#62;;
          Show, Give:
                   if (noun==dictionary &#38;&#38; dictionary hasnt general)
                   {   give dictionary general;
                      "The priest reads a little of the book, laughing
                       in a hollow, whispering way.  Unable to restrain
                       his mirth, he scratches in a correction somewhere
                       before returning the book.";
                   }
                  "The priest is not very interested in earthly things.";
       ],
  has  animate;
</PRE>

(Some of the <TT>Ask</TT> topics are omitted for brevity.)
Of course an <TT>animate</TT> object still has <TT>before</TT> and <TT>after</TT> routines
like any other, so you can trap many other kinds of behaviour.
Animate creatures can also <TT>react_before</TT> and <TT>react_after</TT>, and it's
here that these properties really come into their own:

<PRE>
       react_before
       [; Drop: if (noun==satellite_gadget)
             print "~I wouldn't do that, Mr Bond,~ says Blofeld.^^";
          Shoot: remove beretta;
            "As you draw, Blofeld snaps his fingers and a giant
             magnet snatches the gun from your hand.  It hits the
             ceiling with a clang.  Blofeld silkily strokes his cat.";
       ];
</PRE>


If Blofeld moves from place to place, these rules move with him.

under observation, occasionally mumbling insights such as
"Subject puts green cone on table.
Interesting.''
<P>


Another example is the coiled snake from 'Balances', which
shows that even the tiniest <TT>life</TT> routine can be adequate for an animal:
<PRE>
Object -&#62; snake "hissing snake"
  with name "hissing" "snake",
       initial "Tightly coiled at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.",
       life [; "The snake hisses angrily!"; ],
  has  animate;
</PRE>


<P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/dbend.gif" ALT="/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL> When writing general code to deal with <TT>animate</TT> creatures,
it's sometimes convenient to have a system worked out for printing
pronouns such as "her'' and "He''.  See <A HREF="section22.html">Section 22</A> for one way to do this.
</SMALL>
<TR><TD><TD><P>


Sometimes creatures should be <TT>transparent</TT>, sometimes not.  Consider these
two cases of <TT>animate</TT> characters, for instance:

<P> --  an urchin with something bulging inside his jacket pocket;
<P> --  a hacker who has a bunch of keys hanging off his belt.
<P>


The hacker is <TT>transparent</TT>, the urchin not.  That way the parser prevents
the player from referring to whatever the urchin is hiding, even if the
player has played the game before, and knows what is in there and what it's
called.  But the player can look at and be tantalised by the hacker's
keys.
<P>
<P>


When the player types in something like "pilot, fly south'',
the result is called an 'order': this is the corresponding idea to an
'action'.  (Indeed, if the player types "me, go south'' an
ordinary <TT>Go s_obj</TT> action is produced.)
<P>

The order is sent to the pilot's <TT>orders</TT> property, which may if
it wishes obey or react in some other way.  Otherwise, the standard
game rules will simply print something like "The pilot has better things
to do.''  The above priest is especially unhelpful:
<PRE>
       orders
       [;  Go: "~I must not leave the Shrine.~";
           NotUnderstood: "~You speak in riddles.~";
           default: "~It is not your orders I serve.~";
       ];
</PRE>

(The <TT>NotUnderstood</TT> clause is run when the parser couldn't
understand what the player typed: e.g., "priest, go onrth''.)
<P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/dbend.gif" ALT="/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL> Something to bear in mind is that because the library regards
the words "yes'' and "no'' as being verbs in Inform, it understands
"delores, yes'' as being a <TT>Yes</TT> order.  (This can be a slight
nuisance, as "say yes to delores'' is treated differently: it gets
routed through the <TT>life</TT> routine as an <TT>Answer</TT>.)
</SMALL>
<TR><TD><TD><P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/ddbend.gif" ALT="/\/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL> If the <TT>orders</TT> property returns false (or if there wasn't
an <TT>orders</TT> property in the first place), the order is sent either
to the <TT>Order:</TT> part of the <TT>life</TT> property (if it's understood)
or to the <TT>Answer:</TT> part (if it isn't).  (This is how all orders used to
be processed, and it's retained to avoid making reams of old Inform
code go wrong.)  If these also return false, a message like "X has
better things to do'' or "There is no reply'' is finally printed.

<P>

Some objects are not alive as such, but can be spoken to: microphones,
tape recorders, voice-activated computers and so on.
It would be a nuisance to implement these as <TT>animate</TT>, since they have
none of the other characteristics of life: instead, they can be given
just the attribute <TT>talkable</TT> and <TT>orders</TT> and <TT>life</TT> properties to
deal with the resulting conversation.

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/dbend.gif" ALT="/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL> The rest of this section starts to overlap much more with
Chapter V, and assumes a little familiarity with the parser.
</SMALL>
<TR><TD><TD><P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/dbend.gif" ALT="/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL>  The <TT>NotUnderstood</TT> clause of <TT>orders</TT> is run when the
parser has got stuck parsing an order like "pilot, fly somersaults''.
The variable <TT>etype</TT> holds the parser error that would have been
printed out, had it been a command by the player himself.  See <A HREF="section29.html">Section 29</A>:
for instance, <TT>CANTSEE_PE</TT> would mean "the pilot can't see any such
object''.
</SMALL>
<TR><TD><TD><P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/dbend.gif" ALT="/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL>
When the player issues requests to an <TT>animate</TT> or <TT>talkable</TT> object,
they're normally parsed exactly as if they were commands by the
player himself (except that the <TT>actor</TT> is now the person being
spoken to).  But sometimes one would rather they were parsed by
an entirely different grammar.  For instance, consider Zen, the
flight computer of an alien spacecraft.  It's inappropriate to
tell Zen to (say) pick up a teleport bracelet and the crew tend
to give commands more like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Zen, set course for Centauro''<BR>
"Zen, speed standard by six''<BR>
"Zen, scan 360 orbital''<BR>
"Zen, raise the force wall''<BR>
"Zen, clear the neutron blasters for firing''<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This could mostly be implemented by adding verbs like "raise''
to the usual game grammar (see the 'Starcross' computer exercise
above), or by carefully trapping the <TT>Answer</TT> rule.  But this is
a nuisance, especially if about half the commands you want are
recognised as orders in the usual grammar but the other half aren't.
</SMALL>
<TR><TD><TD><P>

<TR><TD><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL>
An <TT>animate</TT> or <TT>talkable</TT> object can therefore provide a <TT>grammar</TT>
routine (if it likes).  This is called at a time when the parser has
worked out the object that is being addressed and has set the variables
<TT>verb_num</TT> and <TT>verb_word</TT> (to the number of the 'verb' and its
dictionary entry, respectively: for example, in "orac, operate the
teleport'' <TT>verb_num</TT> would be 3 (because the comma counts as a
word on its own) and <TT>verb_word</TT> would be <TT>'operate'</TT>).  The <TT>grammar</TT>
routine can reply by returning:
<P>0. -- The parser carries on as usual.
<P>1. -- The <TT>grammar</TT> routine is saying it has done all the parsing necessary
itself, by hand (i.e., using <TT>NextWord</TT>, <TT>TryNumber</TT>, <TT>NounDomain</TT> and
the like): the variables <TT>action</TT>, <TT>noun</TT> and <TT>second</TT> must be set up
to contain the resulting order.
<P><TT>'verb'</TT> -- The parser ignores the usual grammar and instead works
through the grammar lines for the given verb (see below).
<P><TT>-'verb'</TT> -- Ditto, except that if none of those grammar lines work
then the parser goes back and tries the usual grammar as well.
<P>

 In addition, the <TT>grammar</TT> routine is free to
do some partial parsing of the early words provided it moves on
<TT>verb_num</TT> accordingly to show how much it's got through.

<P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/dbend.gif" ALT="/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL>  It's useful to know that if the player types a comma or a
full stop, then the parser cuts these out as separate words.  Because
of this, a dictionary word containing up to 7 letters and
then a comma or a full stop can never be matched by what the player
types.  Such a word is called an "untypeable verb'', and it's useful
to help a <TT>grammar</TT> routine to shunt parsing into a piece of game
grammar which the player can never use.
For instance, here's a way to implement the 'Starcross'
computer which doesn't involve creating foolish new actions.  We
create grammar:
<PRE>
[ Control;
  switch(NextWord())
  {   'theta': parsed_number=1; return 1;
      'phi':   parsed_number=2; return 1;
      'range': parsed_number=3; return 1;
      default: return -1;
  }
];
Verb "comp," * Control "is" number -&#62; SetTo;
</PRE>

And the computer itself needs properties
<PRE>
       grammar [; return 'comp,'; ],
       orders
       [;  SetTo:
               switch(noun)
               {   1: print "~Theta"; 2: print "~Phi"; 3: print "~Range"; }
               print_ret " set to ", second, ".~";
           default: "~Does not compute!~";
       ];
</PRE>

This may not look easier, but it's much more flexible, as the exercises
below will hopefully demonstrate.
</SMALL>
<TR><TD><TD><P>

<P><TR><TD Valign="top"><IMG SRC="icons/ddbend.gif" ALT="/\/\"><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL> Another use for untypeable verbs is to create what might be
called 'fake fake actions'.  Recall that a fake action is one which
is never generated by the parser, and has no action routine.  Sometimes
(very rarely) you want a proper action but which still can't be
generated by the parser: the following example creates three.
<PRE>
Verb "actions." * -&#62; Prepare * -&#62; Simmer * -&#62; Cook;
</PRE>

The parser never uses "actions.'' in its ordinary grammar, so this
definition has the sole effect of creating three new actions:
<TT>Prepare</TT>, <TT>Simmer</TT> and <TT>Cook</TT>.

The next two exercises really belong to <A HREF="section28.html">Section 28</A>, but are too useful
(for the "someone on the other end of a phone'' situation) to
bury far away.  Note that an alternative to these scope-hacking
tricks, if you just want to implement something like "michael,
tell me about the crystals'' (when Michael is at the other end of the

<TT>'michael'</TT> refer to the phone (using a <TT>parse_name</TT> routine).
<P>

For more on scope hacking, see <A HREF="section28.html">Section 28</A>.  Note that the variable <TT>scope_reason</TT>
is always set to the constant value <TT>TALKING_REASON</TT> when the game is trying
to work out who you wish to talk to: so it's quite easy to make the
scope different for conversational
purposes.

A much fuller example of a 'non-player character' is given in
the example game 'The Thief', by Gareth Rees (though it's
really an implementation of the gentleman in 'Zork', himself
an imitation of the pirate in 'Advent').  The thief is
capable of walking around, being followed, stealing things,
picking locks, opening doors and so on.
<BR> Other good definitions of <TT>animate</TT> objects to look at
are Christopher in 'Toyshop', who will stack up building blocks
on request; the kittens in 'Alice Through The Looking-Glass'; the
barker in 'Balances', and the cast of 'Advent': the little
bird, the snake, bear and dragon, the pirate and of course the
threatening little dwarves.
<BR> Following people means being able to refer to them after
they've left the room: see 'Follow my leader', also by Mr Rees,
or the library extension "follower.h'' by Andrew Clover.
<BR> See the Inform home page for a way round the <TT>Yes</TT>
awkwardness.
<BR> For parsing topics of conversation in advanced ways,
see the example game 'Encyclopaedia Frobozzica'
by Gareth Rees.
<BR> To see how much a good set of characters can do for a
game, try playing the prologue of 'Christminster'.

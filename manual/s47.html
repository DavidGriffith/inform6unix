<blockquote>As we ranged by Gratiosa, on the tenth of September, about
twelve a clocke at night, we saw a large and perfect Rainbow by the 
Moone light, in the bignesse and forme of all other Rainbows, but 
in colour much differing, for it was more whitish, but chiefly
inclining to the colour of the flame of fire.<br>
&#8212; Arthur Gorges, ordinary seaman aboard Sir Walter Raleigh's
expedition (1597)</blockquote>

&#8220;Explain why the game-world exists and thus give a consistency
to the text that you will present to the player&#8221; (Thomas Nilsson,
in the Alan manual). It is worth a look back to compare &#8216;Advent&#8217;
and &#8216;Zork&#8217;, the alpha and omega of the cave game. &#8216;Zork&#8217; 
is better laid out and its middle segments (now called &#8216;Zork 
II&#8217;) are among the smoothest and best structured of any game in 
the literature. And yet for all its dead ends and hidden canyons, 
&#8216;Advent&#8217; is essentially the better work, more memorable 
and more atmospheric, because its roots lie in a true experience.
The mythology of &#8216;Zork&#8217; is far less well-grounded: the 
long-gone Flathead dynasty, beginning in a few throwaway jokes, ended 
up downright tiresome by the time of the later sequels, when the 
&#8220;legend of the Flatheads&#8221; had become, by default, the 
distinguishing feature of Zorkness. Though perfectly engineered, 
&#8216;Zork&#8217; lacks authenticity.</p>

<p class="indent">The most telling argument in favour of a clear fictional 
backdrop is provided by the games which did not have one, and which 
were merely surreal miscellanies of the medieval and the modern. A very 
few, such as &#8216;Brand X&#8217; by Peter Killworth and the chess 
grandmaster Jonathan Mestel (1982: later called &#8216;Philosopher's 
Quest&#8217;), came stubbornly alive through their ruthless difficulty.
&#8216;Brand X&#8217; lacks even a descriptive title &#8211; there 
is no setting or plot to describe &#8211; and the overture reads: 
&#8220;You don't need instructions, so you won't get any.&#8221;
But in the main such games are indistinguishable from each other and 
are justly forgotten.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Here is a revealing moment from &#8216;The Hitchhiker's 
Guide To The Galaxy&#8217; (Steve Meretzky and Douglas Adams, 1984):</p>

<p class="output">Ford yawns. &#8220;Matter transference always tires 
me out. I'm going to take a nap.&#8221; He places something on top of 
his satchel. &#8220;If you have any questions, 
here's The Hitchhiker's 
<a id="p375" name="p375"></a>
Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to 
a whisper. &#8220;I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never
be able to finish the game without consulting the Guide about lots of 
stuff.&#8221; As he curls up in a corner and begins snoring, you pick 
up The Hitchhiker's Guide.</p>

<p class="normal">Why does Ford feel the need to whisper? Who supposes that 
Ford should not say such things? Roger Giner-Sorolla does, for one. 
His 1996 essays <i>Crimes Against Mimesis</i> put the case for the 
prosecution of such passages:</p>

<blockquote>I see successful fiction as an imitation or &#8220;mimesis&#8221; 
of reality, be it this world's or an alternate world's. Well-written fiction 
leads the reader to temporarily enter and believe in the reality of 
that world. A crime against mimesis is any aspect &#8230; that breaks 
the coherence of its fictional world as a representation of reality.</blockquote>

<p class="normal">This elegant polemic, posted to <tt>rec.arts.int-fiction</tt>, 
provided the <i>mise au point</i> for a debate which rumbled on for 
some months.<a id="s47_fnref1" name="s47_fnref1"></a><a href="#s47_fn1">&#8224;</a>
The target was not so much the tripping over of mimesis in a pratfall, 
as in the passage above, but the accidental undermining of mimesis by 
careless authors. The placing of objects out of context or of characters 
without motivation, the bending of genres to include whimsical anachronisms 
or the use of puzzles which are out of context (a sliding block puzzle 
to solve in a ruined crypt) are problematic because they emphasise exactly 
what ought to be concealed, that the game is a collection of puzzles 
to solve. From this view it follows that a game should have a coherent 
fictional world and its puzzles should be seamlessly joined to the 
textual fabric, appearing to occur naturally.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The secret of success in designing the backdrop is 
originality: once you can imitate that, all else will follow. Probably 
the most popular source is real life, and for many games design begins 
with, and is periodically interrupted by, research. If constructing 
geography, maps of real mountain ranges, river valleys and cave systems 
can be a helpful reminder that real geography is convoluted and continuous 
&#8211; if a river passes through a given location, it must continue
elsewhere, and so on. (More on this in <a href="s51.html">&#167;51</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent">For &#8216;Jigsaw&#8217; (Graham Nelson, 1995), a 
game containing historical re-enactments, the present author began 
by wandering along the open shelves of Oxford County Library with 
pockets full of coins to photocopy pages at random. Later there came 
the 1956 run of the <i>Eagle</i> comic in facsimile (for views of 
the British Empire at the time of Suez as expressed in fiction for boys), 
<a id="p376" name="p376"></a>
the Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal (Eric Jones's superb 
Internet resource, now officially adopted by NASA) and, for the 1900 
sequence of the game, Stephen Poliakoff's excellent film <i>Century</i>. 
As this may suggest, research can be overdone. Here is Stu Galley, 
on writing the Chandleresque murder mystery &#8216;The Witness&#8217; 
(1983):</p>

<blockquote>Soon my office bookshelf had an old Sears catalogue and 
a pictorial history of advertising (to help me furnish the house and 
clothe the characters), the <i>Dictionary of American Slang</i> (to 
add colour to the text) and a 1937 desk encyclopaedia (to weed 
out anachronisms).</blockquote>

<p class="normal">And so we walk up the peastone drive of the Linder 
house to meet Monica, who has dark waved hair and wears a navy Rayon 
blouse, tan slacks and tan pumps with Cuban heels, and she treats us 
like a masher who just gave her a whistle. In a game which is intended 
to be a little kitsch, this is all in good fun. In a more serious work 
it would be way off balance.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Book adaptations present two main problems for interactive 
fiction. Plenty have been made: Frederik Pohl's <i>Gateway</i>, a 
masterpiece of &#8220;hard&#8221; science fiction, and the books of 
J. R. R. Tolkien, Terry Pratchett and Enid Blyton have all lent their 
extensive imaginary worlds. But in each case by permission. Even 
if no money changes hands, copyright law is enforceable until fifty 
or seventy years (depending on jurisdiction) after the death of the 
author or the author's spouse. There are nineteenth-century novels 
still subject to copyright and numerous characters have been trademarked.
Some literary estates, that of Tintin for instance, are highly protective, 
and the rights managers of Anne McCaffrey's &#8220;Dragon&#8221; books 
or Paramount's <i>Star Trek</i> franchise are assiduous in watching 
for abuse of their property by authors on the Internet: understandably, 
since a venture by Marion Zimmer Bradley in authorising fan fiction 
ended in miserable litigation. The Commodore 64 game &#8216;HitchHiker-64&#8217; 
(Bob Chappell, 1984), an unauthorised work loosely based on Douglas
Adams's comedy had to be hastily rewritten as &#8216;Cosmic Capers&#8217;, 
with the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal becoming the somehow less 
satisfying Barbaric Binge Beast of Bongo.</p>

<p class="indent">The second problem is that, in any case, a direct 
linear plot simply does not work as an adventure game and a novel is 
too long for a game, just as it is for a film: both are nearer to a 
longish short story. Dave Lebling reckoned &#8216;Shogun&#8217; (1989), 
an authorised version of James Clavell's epic novel, the worst not 
only of his own games but of all Infocom's too. (Graeme Cree: &#8220;Too 
often the story just seems to go on around you while you get meaningless 
points for smiling, nodding, or bowing at the right times.&#8221; 
Torbj&ouml;rn Andersson: 
<a id="p377" name="p377"></a>
&#8220;it never lets you stray more than a 
few baby-steps from the pre-determined story&#8221;.) &#8216;Sherlock&#8217; 
(Bob Bates, 1987) was on the whole more successful, not because Conan 
Doyle is more interesting &#8211; he is so familiar that the reverse
is true, and besides, Bates overplayed the camp humour &#8211; but because 
the game was a pastiche, not a slavish adaptation. The same can be said 
of &#8216;Wonderland&#8217; (David Bishop, 1990), one of the few Alice-based 
games not to follow the text. Shakespeare's &#8216;The Tempest&#8217; 
has been adapted at least twice for interactive fiction (David R. Grigg, 
1992; Graham Nelson, 1997) but Jonathan Partington's confection 
of Shakespearian settings, &#8216;Avon&#8217; (1982), is more fun 
than either. Puzzles range across most of the plays in a mad rush, from 
hiding in a laundry basket (<i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>) to 
borrowing three thousand ducats (<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>) and one 
is really best advised not to eat the pie from <i>Titus Andronicus</i>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
The tension between open-ended simulation and narrative has attracted 
much comment. David Graves's three papers <i>Second Generation Adventure 
Games</i> (J. of Computer Game Design, 1987) have little to say. Gerry 
Kevin Wilson observes that &#8220;The Minimalists argue that games should 
be an experience in exploration and simulation. They want to be able 
to start their own plots and toss them aside at will. In my opinion,
they are very dangerous people.&#8221; Mike Roberts, in the appendix 
to <i>The TADS Author's Manual</i>, writes: &#8220;Adventure games all 
have a major problem: they pretend to be what they're not &#8230;
Adventures are simulations. Unfortunately, most adventures claim 
to be simulations of the real world&#8230; The key is to choose a small 
universe that you can model completely.&#8221; He develops this idea 
of self-containment by suggesting that design should concentrate on 
a single important usage for each object, with irrelevant connections 
added only later.</p>

<P>


Obviously, a slightly wider repertoire of actions might be a good idea,
but:
<PRE>
Object -&#62; Charlotte "Charlotte"
  with name "charlotte" "charlie" "chas",
       grammar
       [;  give self ~general;
           wn=verb_wordnum;
           if (NextWord()=='simon' &#38;&#38; NextWord()=='says')
           {   give self general;
               verb_wordnum=verb_wordnum+2;
           }
       ],
       orders
       [ i;  if (self hasnt general) "Charlotte sticks her tongue out.";
           WaveHands: "Charlotte waves energetically.";
           default: "~Don't know how,~ says Charlotte.";
       ],
       initial "Charlotte wants to play Simon Says.",
  has  animate female proper;
</PRE>

(The variable <TT>i</TT> isn't needed yet, but will be used by the
code added in the answer to the next exercise.)

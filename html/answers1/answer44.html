<P>

The common man's <I> wayhel</I> was a lowly mouse.  Since we think
much more highly of the player:
<PRE>
Object hog "Warthog" Caldera
  with name "wart" "hog" "warthog", description "Muddy and grunting.",
       number 0,
       initial "A warthog snuffles and grunts about in the ash.",
       orders
       [;  Go, Look, Examine, Eat, Smell, Taste, Touch: rfalse;
           default: "Warthogs can't do anything as tricky as that!";
       ],
  has  animate proper;
</PRE>

and we just <TT>ChangePlayer(warthog);</TT>.  Note that the same <TT>orders</TT>
routine applies to the player-as-human typing "warthog, listen''
as to the player-as-warthog typing just "listen''.

<P>

Because you don't know what order daemons will run in.  A
'fatigue' daemon which makes the player drop something might come
after the 'mid-air' daemon has run for this turn.  Whereas <TT>each_turn</TT>
happens after daemons and timers have run their course, and can fairly
assume no further movements will take place this
turn.

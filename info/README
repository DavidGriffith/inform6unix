Comments
--------

There is no Texinfo version of this manual.  If you want a printed copy,
get the original TeX version and print that.  This Info version is only
designed for online reading.

Comments about the manual should be sent to its author, Graham Nelson
<graham@gnelson.demon.co.uk>.  Comments about the formatting of this Info
version should be sent to me, Chris Madsen <ac608@yfn.ysu.edu>.  While the
formatting could certainly be improved, and so could the index, I haven't
time to do it.  Feel free to volunteer.

On the other hand, I haven't given this new edition as thorough a
proofreading as I would like, because I wanted to get it released.  If you
find something that looks wrong, please let me know about it.  I may have
overlooked it.

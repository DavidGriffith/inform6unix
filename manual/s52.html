<h2>&#167;52 &nbsp; Finishing</h2>

<blockquote>&#8220;[A game in alpha-testing has] on the order of 4,000 
bugs. Maybe fifty percent are spelling and punctuation errors, extra 
spaces, missing blank lines, and so on. Maybe one percent are crashes.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I try to make sure that the sun is in the right position, or 
if you're in outer space the sun and moon are where they're supposed 
to be &#8211; stuff like that&#8230; The wooden beam [in 
&#8216;Infidel&#8217;] is described as being a certain length and width, 
and I calculated that it would have to weigh 500 pounds.&#8221;<br>
&#8212; Max Buxton and Gary Brennan (Infocom play-testers), 1987</blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-412_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
So the game is built: the wood is rough and splintered, but it's recognisably 
a game. There is still a good month's work to do, easier work if less 
creative, and beyond that a good deal of drudgery to fix bug after bug 
after bug.<a id="s52_fnref1" name="s52_fnref1"></a><a
href="#s52_fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> The first post-design task is to sort
out the scoring system, usually awarding points out of some pleasingly 
round number and dividing them into rankings. Here is &#8216;Zork II&#8217;:</p>

<p class="output">Beginner (0), Amateur Adventurer (40), Novice Adventurer 
(80), Junior Adventurer (160), Adventurer (240), Master (320), Wizard 
(360), Master Adventurer (400)</p>

<p class="normal">This is disappointingly bland, and a more pleasing 
tradition is to name ranks for the player's profession in the game 
&#8211; so that an orchestral musician might begin as Triangle and 
rise through Second Violinist to Conductor. (In &#8216;Sherlock&#8217;,
the lowest rank &#8211; corresponding to zero achievement &#8211; is 
Chief Superintendent of Scotland Yard.) Among the questions to ask are: 
will every winner of the game necessarily score exactly 400 out of 400? 
(This can be difficult to arrange if even small acts are scored.) Will 
everyone entering the end game already 
<a id="p413" name="p413"></a>
have a score of 360, and so 
have earned the title &#8220;Wizard&#8221;? Will the rank &#8220;Amateur&#8221; 
correspond exactly to having got out of the prologue and into the
middle game?</p>

<p class="indent">Unless the scoring system is worked out and the game 
can pass its entire transcript of the &#8220;winning&#8221; solution 
without crashing or giving absurd replies, it is too soon to go into 
play-testing.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Scoring systems vary greatly. &#8216;Adventure Quest&#8217; is scored 
&#8220;out of about 6,000&#8221;, and exemplifies the pinball-machine-like 
tendency to offer points by 5s, 10s or 100s. Other games feel that one 
puzzle is one point, or award percentages, and still others frown on 
score altogether because &#8220;that's not how life works&#8221;. 
In &#8216;Moonmist&#8217;, scores are described thus: &#8220;[Well, 
so far you've met Lord Jack and all of the guests, washed up from 
your trip... but you haven't found the hidden treasure nor enough 
evidence nor identified the ghost!]&#8221;. In &#8216;Zork III&#8217;, 
the player's &#8220;potential&#8221; is given out of 7, corresponding 
to which of seven challenges have been encountered (so that a score 
of 7 does not mean the game is over). In &#8216;The Lurking Horror&#8217;, 
20 major puzzles are awarded 5 points apiece for a maximum of 100: 
the 20th puzzle is to win the game. In some ports of &#8216;Advent&#8217; 
1 point is awarded for each room visited for the first time, and 1 
for never having saved the game, a mean trick, plus the infamous 
&#8220;Last Lousy Point&#8221;, awarded without any clue for dropping 
a particular object in a particular place, an irrelevant act achieving 
nothing. (People used to have to disassemble the mainframe game to 
discover this.)</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">During the writing and maintenance of 
&#8216;Christminster&#8217;, Gareth Rees kept a log of all 475 
modifications prompted by play-testers and players. This log is archived 
with the game's source code at <tt>ftp.gmd.de</tt> and makes an interesting
case study. 224 reports requested additional interactivity and responses, 
often to reasonable but wrong guesses made by the player. A further 86 
arose from incorrect responses or inconsistencies, 32 from typographical 
errors and 79 from mistakes in computer programming, for instance 
in the game's complicated algorithms to handle telephony and the mixing 
of liquids.</p>

<p class="indent">At every stage in writing an interactive fiction 
it is easy to lapse into the habit of writing an uninteractive one. 
A designer who has written a linear story and then introduced some 
puzzles may imagine that the literary style and effect of the game 
comes from the text originally written, but that isn't altogether true: 
most of the player's time at the keyboard is spent trying the wrong 
thing, so most of the player's experience of the game lies in how 
it deals with wrong guesses. This means that it's essential to respond 
to as many of attempts as possible, acknowledging that the player has 
made honest attempts, and so helping to form a sort of relationship:</p>

<a id="p414" name="p414"></a>
<p class="output">In the aquarium is a baby sea-serpent who eyes 
you suspiciously. His scaly body writhes about in the huge tank.<br>
&gt;<tt>take serpent</tt><br>
He takes you instead. *Uurrp!*</p>

<p class="normal">This is from &#8216;Zork II&#8217;, a program which 
is at least twice the size of &#8216;Advent&#8217; in spite of implementing 
a much smaller design. Almost all of that disparity is due to its 
generous stock of responses. Similarly, &#8216;Zork I&#8217; contains 
possibly the first examples of alternative solutions to puzzles (the 
cyclops can be defeated in two different ways, as can the Loud Room). 
If a play-tester can think of a reasonable solution to which the game 
does not respond, it is worth considering a redesign of the puzzle 
to allow both solutions. Even if not, a response should be made which 
acknowledges that the player has made a good guess.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Bugs in interactive fiction are individually puny, yet 
daunting by their number, like a column of army ants. Just as the 
&#8216;Christminster&#8217; log (see above) gives an idea of routine 
testing, so Graeme Cree's catalogue of bugs in released Infocom games 
(at <tt>www.xyzzynews.com</tt>) shows what can slip through the most 
rigorous testing regime. Here are some common types of bug:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slips of punctuation, spelling or grammar: for instance, &#8220;a 
orange&#8221;. Infocom's games are quite clean in this respect, in 
part because an experienced editor of books, John Prince, proof-read their 
text. (The Inform compiler allows a designer to extract all the text 
of a game for spell-checking.)</li>
<li>Rooms being dark when they ought to be light (which tends not to 
show if the designer habitually carries a lamp when testing), or not 
changing their state of light/darkness when they should: as for instance 
when a skylight opens, or when the sun sets, or when the candles in 
&#8216;Zork I&#8217; are blown out. In &#8216;Sherlock&#8217; (21/871214)
an expert player can cross fog-bound London without a lamp, exploiting 
various items and places which turn out to have (undescribed) light.</li>
<li>Secondary properties of an object neglected: such as a fish being 
marked as edible, or a door as fixed in place.<a id="s52_fnref2"
name="s52_fnref2"></a><a href="#s52_fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>
&#8216;Starcross&#8217; (15/820901) neglected to mark a light beam as 
being inanimate, so that the player could get rid of it by typing 
&#8220;beam, go west&#8221;.</li>
<li>Map connections missed or mismatching. In &#8216;Suspended&#8217; 
(8/840521), the corridor northeast from East End to Alpha FC has no 
connection back southwest: the designer simply forgot to make one.</li>
<li>Something which ought to happen only once being possible more 
than once: such as the breaking of a window, or a character greeting 
the player as a stranger. The only known bug in any release of 
&#8216;Wishbringer&#8217; (68/850501) allowed the player 
<a id="p415" name="p415"></a>
to take back a spent gold coin and spend it again, gaining ever more 
points <i>ad infinitum</i>.</li>
<li>Failing to properly revise the state of the game after a major 
event. In &#8216;Deadline&#8217; (18/820311), Ms Dunbar was sometimes 
able to appear even after her death and, indeed, to be present in 
the same room as her dead body.</li>
<li>Small illogicalities: messages such as &#8220;The ball bounces on 
the ground and returns to your hand.&#8221; in mid-air or while wading 
through a ford; or being able to swim with a suit of armour on, or 
wave the coat you're wearing, or eat while wearing a gas mask. In 
&#8216;Hollywood Hijinx&#8217; (37/861215), you can empty a bucket 
of water while swimming underwater.</li>
<li>Failing to check that necessary objects are actually present when 
the player tries by implication to use them. In &#8216;The Witness&#8217; 
(22/840924), you can &#8220;get a drink&#8221; anywhere in the game.</li>
<li>Containers with surreal abilities: such as a purse which can hold 
a stepladder, or a candle whose flame remains lit, or a book which 
can still be read even when stowed away inside a rucksack. Infocom's 
struggle with the &#8216;Zork&#8217; container bug has passed into 
legend. Numerous cases were attended to, but in all eleven releases of 
&#8216;Zork I&#8217; you can still put the raft in the coffin, and 
then the coffin in the raft, causing both to vanish.</li>
<li>Forgotten names: for instance &#8216;Planetfall&#8217; (20/830708) 
forgot to allow the player to call the microbe monster &#8220;microbe&#8221;.</li>
<li>Inadequate namings: in &#8216;Deadline&#8217; (19/820427) the 
bathroom door on the first floor was impossible to open because the 
game called it simply &#8220;door&#8221;, but with a closet door in 
the same location, an ambiguity arose which nothing the player could 
type would resolve.</li>
<li>Actual bugs in code intended to extend the game's simulation of 
the world, and especially with ropes and liquids: in &#8216;Infidel&#8217; 
(22/830916) filling the chalice when it is already full results in 
the text &#8220;The silver chalice is filled with water. The silver 
chalice is empty.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">The days of play-testing are harrowing. Dave Lebling

<p class="normal">(&#8220;Little bugs, you know? Things no one would 
notice. At this point the tester's job is fairly easy. The story is 
like a house of cards &#8211; it looks pretty solid but the slightest 
touch collapses it.&#8221;)</p>

<a id="p416" name="p416"></a>
<p class="indent">Good play-testers are worth their weight in gold. 
Their first contribution is to try things in a systematically perverse 
way. To quote Michael Kinyon, whose effect may be felt almost everywhere 
in the present author's games,</p>

<blockquote>A tester with a new verb is like a kid with a hammer; 
every problem seems like a nail.</blockquote>

<p class="normal">And here is Neil deMause, on one of his play-testers:</p>

<blockquote>He has an odd compulsion, when he plays IF games, to 
close doors behind him. It's a bizarre fastidiousness, not even remotely 
useful for an IF player, but I love him for it, because he has uncovered 
bugs in this way that I never would have found.</blockquote>

<p class="normal">Games substantially grow in play-testing, and come 
alive. Irene Callaci's acknowledgements could speak for all designers:</p>

<blockquote>I thought perhaps beta testing might reveal a couple of 
odd, off-the-wall commands that weren't implemented, or maybe a typo 
here and there, or possibly an adjective or two I had forgotten. Not! 
I wasn't even close to being finished, and I didn't even know it. 
&#8216;Mother Loose&#8217; grew from 151K to 199K during the beta testing 
period alone. Looking back now, if I had released &#8216;Mother 
Loose&#8217; when I thought it was ready, I would have crawled under 
a rock from embarrassment. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all
my beta testers.</blockquote>

<p class="normal">More is true even than this: the play-tester is to 
interactive fiction as the editor is to the novel, and should be credited 
and acknowledged as such. Major regions of &#8216;Curses&#8217; and 
&#8216;Jigsaw&#8217; were thrown out politely but firmly by my own
play-testers as being substandard or unsuitable.<a id="s52_fnref3"
name="s52_fnref3"></a><a href="#s52_fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>
A radical response to the play-tester's doubts is almost always better 
than papering over cracks.</p>

<p class="indent">After a first pass by one or two play-testers, and 
a consequent redrafting exercise, the game can go to beta testing at 
the hands of perhaps six or seven volunteers, who come to it fresh 
and treat it more as an entertainment and less as an unexploded bomb. 
(At one time Infocom used two phases of beta-testing, sometimes involving 
as many as 200 volunteers, even after pre-alpha and alpha-testing 
in house.) It is wise to insist on reports in writing or email, or
some concrete form, and to ask for a series of reports, one at a time, 
rather than waiting a month for an epic list of bugs. It can be useful 
for play-testers to keep transcripts of their sessions with the 
game, and send them verbatim, because these transcripts are eloquent 
of how difficult or easy the puzzles are and which wrong guesses are 
tried. In its debugging version, &#8216;Jigsaw&#8217; provided a verb
called &#8220;bug&#8221; purely to help players type comments into 
such a transcript:</p>

<a id="p417" name="p417"></a>
<p class="output">&gt;<tt>bug Miss Shutes is known as he</tt><br>
Oh dear.<br>
&gt;<tt>bug The corn bread isn't edible</tt><br>
Is that so?</p>

<p class="normal">It is worth keeping in touch with play-testers to 
ensure that they are not utterly stuck because of a bug or an unreasonable 
puzzle, but it's important to give no hints unless they are asked 
for.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">A game is never finished, only abandoned. There 
is always one more bug, or one more message which could be improved, or 
one more wry response to drop in. Debugging is a creative process, even 
beyond the initial release, and games commonly have four to ten revisions 
in their first couple of years in play. In the end, of course, the designer 
walks away. Almost all the pre-1990 designers cited in the bibliography 
are still alive, but few are still designing, and they often speak of 
their games as something fun but belonging to another time in their 
lives: something they feel faintly self-conscious about, perhaps, something 
that they did years ago: when they were in high school, when their kids 
were young, when they did a little testing for Infocom, when computers
were less visual, when it was the state of the art, when the Ph.D. was 
at an impasse. But if twenty-five years is an epoch in computing, it 
is not a long time in the history of art, and the early designers remain 
a presence in a genre which is younger and less settled than sometimes 
appears. Once in a while Scott Adams causes a frisson by throwing a 
remark into a newsgroup mostly read by designers to whom he seems a 
historical figure coeval with Scott of the Antarctic. Can such a man 
really have an email address?</p>

<p class="indent">In a recent radio broadcast (1999), Douglas Adams 
said that the great enjoyability of working on his games with Infocom 
was having fun with a new medium before it became an art form and had 
serious articles written about it. (Which pretty much puts this chapter 
in its place.) But that original fascination dies hard, and the first 
and happiest discovery of anyone researching into interactive fiction 
is that designers past are only too pleased to be rediscovered, and 
willing to go to great trouble &#8211; hunting through archives, attics 
and obsolete equipment &#8211; to see that their games can be trodden 
again.</p>

<p class="indent">An adventure game can be one of the most satisfying 
of works to have written: perhaps because one can always polish it 
a little further, perhaps because it has hidden and secret possibilities.
But perhaps too because something is made as well as written: and 
once made can never be unmade, so that there will always be a small 
brick building by the end of the road, and in it there will always 
be keys, food, a bottle and the lamp.</p>

Dave Lebling starts work in the morning: &#8220;Even a cup of yummy coffee 
won't improve things when you see &#8216;page 1 of 12&#8217; on the 
first bug report form.&#8221; Many good-natured pieces about testing 
appear in Infocom's publicity newspapers. At best, it was enormous 
fun, and Liz Cyr-Jones's testing department made a lively and exhilarating
summer job. But there were also tensions. The tester who wrote that 12-page 
form saw it not as dismaying but as the proud result of a job well done. 
It could be frustrating that the bugs would be fixed at random intervals, 
or not at all, while revised versions of the game would sometimes arrive 
without any clear indication of what had altered. Brian Moriarty redesigned 
great swathes of game at the last minute, and the fact that he had 
always said he would did not make this any less maddening.</p>

<p class="aside"><a id="s52_fn2" name="s52_fn2"></a><a

It wasn't until the fifth proofs of <a href="s12.html">&#167;12</a>

<h2>&#167;43 &nbsp; Pictures, sounds, blurbs and Blorb</h2>

<blockquote>The blorb spell (safely protect a small object as though 
in a strong box).<br>&#8212; Marc Blank and P. David Lebling, 
&#8216;Enchanter&#8217;</blockquote>

Pictures may, but need not, accompany a Version 6 game. They are not 
stored in the story file itself, and different interpreters make different 
arrangements for getting access to them. Some interpreters can only 
read low-resolution, low-colour-range images in the awkward format used 
by Infocom's graphical games. Others take pictures from a &#8220;Blorb 
file&#8221; which can hold high-resolution and riotously colourful
images in a format called PNG. The story file neither knows nor 
cares which, and refers to pictures only by their numbers.</p>

<p class="indent">A Blorb file can also safely protect sound effects 
and even the story file itself, so that a game and its multi-media 
resources can be a single file. Blorb is a simple format largely devised 
by Andrew Plotkin (partly based on the same author's earlier &#8220;Pickle&#8221;); 
it has been fully implemented in Kevin Bracey's &#8216;Zip2000&#8217; 
interpreter for Acorn RISC OS machines, and is also used by the new 
&#8220;glulx&#8221; format of story files.</p>

<p class="indent">A Perl script called perlBlorb, runnable on many 
models of computer, gathers together sounds and images and constructs 
Blorb files as needed, from a list of instructions called a &#8220;blurb 
file&#8221;. For instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
! Example of a blurb file
copyright &quot;Angela M. Horns 1998&quot;
release 17
palette 16 bit
resolution 600x400
storyfile &quot;games/sherbet.z5&quot;
sound    creak  &quot;sounds/creaking.snd&quot;
sound    wind   &quot;sounds/wind.snd&quot;
picture  flag     &quot;flag_1.jpg&quot;      scale 3/1
picture  pattern  &quot;backdrop_1.jpg&quot;
</pre>

<p class="normal">When run through perlBlorb, the above produces the 
text below:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
! perlBlorb 1.0 [executing on 980124 at 15:31.33]
Constant SOUND_creak = 3;<a id="p332" name="p332"></a>
Constant SOUND_wind = 4;
Constant PICTURE_flag = 1;
Constant PICTURE_pattern = 2;
! Completed: size 45684 bytes (2 pictures, 2 sounds)
</pre>

<p class="indent">This output text looks like Inform source code, 
and this is not an accident: the idea is that it can be used as an 
<code>Include</code> file to give sensible names to the sound and 
picture numbers, so that the rest of the code can include statements
like this one:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">@sound_effect SOUND_creak 2 128 255;</pre>

<p class="normal">(&#8220;start playing this effect at about half 
maximum volume, repeating it indefinitely&#8221;). An attractive alternative 
is to use a convenient class library, such as <tt>&quot;V6Lib.h&quot;</tt> 
by Jason Penney, to avoid messing about with assembly language.</p>

<p class="indent">You're free to specify the numbering yourself, and 
you need not give names for the pictures and sounds. A blurb command like:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">picture &quot;backdrop.png&quot;</pre>

<p class="normal">gives this image the next picture number: i.e., the 
previous picture number plus 1, or just 1 if it's the first specified 
picture. On the other hand, a blurb command like:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">picture 100 &quot;backdrop.png&quot;</pre>

<p class="normal">gives it picture number 100. The only restriction 
is that pictures must be given in increasing numerical order. The 
numbering of sounds is similar.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The full specification for the &#8220;blurb&#8221; language is as 
follows. With one exception (see palette below) each command occupies 
one and only one line of text. Lines are permitted to be empty or 
to contain only white space. Lines whose first non-white-space character 
is an exclamation mark are treated as comments, that is, ignored. 
(&#8220;White space&#8221; means spaces and tab characters.)</p>

<p class="aside">&#8249;<span class="token">string</span>&#8250;
means any text within double-quotes, not containing either double-quote 
or new-line characters</p>

<p class="aside">&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;
means a decimal number in the range 0 to 32767</p>

<p class="aside">&#8249;<span class="token">id</span>&#8250;
means either nothing at all, or a &#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;, or 
a sequence of up to 20 letters, digits or underscore characters&nbsp;<tt>_</tt></p>

<a id="p333" name="p333"></a>
<p class="aside">&#8249;<span class="token">dim</span>&#8250; indicates 
screen dimensions, and must take the form 
&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;<code>x</code>&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="aside">&#8249;<span class="token">ratio</span>&#8250; is a fraction 
in the form 
&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;<code>/</code>&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;. 
<code>0/0</code> is legal but otherwise both numbers must be positive</p>

<p class="aside">&#8249;<span class="token">colour</span>&#8250; is a 
colour expressed as six hexadecimal digits, as in some HTML tags: 
for instance <code>F5DEB3</code> is the colour of wheat, with red value 
<code>F5</code> (on a scale <code>00</code>, none, to <code>FF</code>,
full), green value <code>DE</code> and blue value <code>B3</code>. 
Hexadecimal digits may be given in either upper or lower case.</p>

<p class="aside">With the exception of picture and sound, each type 
of command can only occur at most once in any blurb file. Commands 
can be used in any order or not at all: an empty &#8220;blurb&#8221; 
file results in a perfectly legal, if useless, Blorb file. The full 
set of commands is as follows:</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>copyright </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">string</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="aside">Adds this copyright declaration to the file. It would 
normally consist of the author's name and the date.</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>release </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">number</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="aside">Gives this release number to the file. This is the 
number returned by the opcode <code>@picture_data 0</code> within 
any game using the Blorb file, and might be used when printing out 
version information.</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>palette 16 bit</tt><br>
<tt>palette 32 bit</tt><br>
<tt>palette {</tt> &#8249;<span
class="token">colour-1</span>&#8250; &#8230; &#8249;<span
class="token">colour-<i>N</i></span>&#8250; <tt>}</tt></p>

<p class="aside">Blorb allows designers to signal to the interpreter that 
a particular colour-scheme is in use. The first two options simply suggest 
that the pictures are best displayed using at least 16-bit, or 32-bit, 
colours. The third option specifies colours used in the pictures in
terms of red/green/blue levels, and the braces allow the sequence of 
colours to continue over many lines. At least one and at most 256 colours 
may be defined in this way. This is only a &#8220;clue&#8221; to the 
interpreter; see the Blorb specification for details.</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>resolution </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">dim</span>&#8250;<br>
<tt>resolution </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">dim</span>&#8250;<tt> min </tt>&#8249;<span

class="token">dim</span>&#8250;<tt> min </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">dim</span>&#8250;<tt> max </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">dim</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="aside">Allows the designer to signal a preferred screen size, 
in real pixels, in case the interpreter should have any choice over this. 
The minimum and maximum values are the extreme values at which the 
designer thinks the game will be playable: they're optional, the default 
values being <code>0x0</code> and infinity by infinity.</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>storyfile </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">string</span>&#8250;<br><a id="p334" name="p334"></a>
<tt>storyfile </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">string</span>&#8250;<tt> include</tt></p>

<p class="aside">Tells perlBlorb the filename of the Z-code story 
file which these resources are being provided for. (There is no need 
to do this if you prefer not to.) Usually the Blorb file simply contains 
a note of the release number, serial code and checksum of the story 
file, which an interpreter can try to match at run-time to see if the 
Blorb file and story file go together. If the <code>include</code> 
option is used, however, the entire story file is embedded within 
the Blorb file, so that game and resources are all bound up in one single 
file.</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>sound </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">id</span>&#8250; &#8249;<span
class="token">string</span>&#8250;<br>

<tt>sound </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">id</span>&#8250; &#8249;<span

<tt>sound </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">id</span>&#8250; &#8249;<span
class="token">string</span>&#8250;<tt> song</tt></p>

<p class="aside">Tells perlBlorb to take a sound sample from the named 
file and make it the sound effect with the given number. The file should 
be an AIFF file unless <code>music</code> is specified, in which case it should be 
a MOD file (roughly speaking a SoundTracker file); or unless
<code>song</code> is specified, in which case it should be a song 
file (roughly, a SoundTracker file using other Blorb sound effects as 
note samples). Note that repeat information (the number of repeats to 
be played) is meaningful only with version 3 story files using sound 
effects, as only Infocom's &#8216;The Lurking Horror&#8217; ever has.</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>picture </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">id</span>&#8250; &#8249;<span
class="token">string</span>&#8250;<br>
<tt>picture </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">id</span>&#8250; &#8249;<span

class="token">ratio</span>&#8250;<br>
<i>and so on</i></p>

<p class="aside">Similarly for pictures: the named file must be a 
PNG-format image. Optionally, the designer can specify a scale factor 
at which the interpreter will display the image &#8211; or, alternatively, 
a range of acceptable scale factors, from which the interpreter may 
choose its own scale factor. (By default an image is not scaleable 
and an interpreter must display it pixel-for-pixel.) There are three 
optional scale factors given: the preferred scale factor, the minimum 
and the maximum allowed. The minimum and maximum each default to the 
preferred value if not given, and the default preferred scale factor 
is 1. Scale factors are expressed as fractions: so for instance,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">picture &quot;flag/png&quot; scale 3/1</pre>

<p class="aside">means &#8220;always display three times its normal 
size&#8221;, whereas</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">picture &quot;backdrop/png&quot; scale min 1/10 max 8/1</pre>

<p class="aside">means &#8220;you can display this anywhere between 
one tenth normal size and eight times normal size, but if possible it 
ought to be just its normal size&#8221;.</p>

There are some constants which, if defined in your code before the
library files are included, change the standard game rules or tell
the Inform library about your game. Two such constants appeared back 
in <a href="s4.html">&#167;4</a>: 
the strings of text <code>Story</code> and <code>Headline</code>.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant Story &quot;ZORK II&quot;;
Constant Headline &quot;^An Interactive Plagiarism^

</pre>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The library won't allow the player to carry an indefinite 
number of objects. As was mentioned in <a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a>, 
the limit is the value of <code>capacity</code> for the current 
player-object, which you're free to vary during play. The library 
sets up the <code>capacity</code> of the usual player-object to be 
equal to a constant called <code>MAX_CARRIED</code>, which is 
normally 100. But you can define it differently, and &#8216;Ruins&#8217; 
does:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant MAX_CARRIED = 7;</pre>

<p class="normal">For these purposes a <code>container</code> counts 
as only one object, even if it contains hundreds of other objects.</p>

<p class="indent">Many games, perhaps too many, involve collecting 
vast miscellanies of items until a use has been found for each. A 
small value of <code>MAX_CARRIED</code> will then annoy the player 
unreasonably, whereas a large one will stretch plausibility. The 
standard resolution is to give the player a sack for carrying spare 
objects, and the Inform library provides a feature whereby the 
designer can nominate a given <code>container</code> to be this 
&#8220;sack&#8221;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object satchel &quot;satchel&quot;
  with description &quot;Big and with a smile painted on it.&quot;,
       name 'satchel', article 'your',
       when_closed &quot;Your satchel lies on the floor.&quot;,
       when_open &quot;Your satchel lies open on the floor.&quot;,
  has  container open openable;
Constant SACK_OBJECT = satchel;
</pre>

<a id="p171" name="p171"></a>
<p class="normal">(This is from &#8216;Toyshop&#8217;: the 
&#8216;Ruins&#8217; have been sacked too many times as it is.) 
The convenience this offers is that the game will now automatically 
put old, least-used objects away into the sack as the game progresses, 
provided the sack is still being carried:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>get biscuit</tt><br>
(putting the old striped scarf into the canvas rucksack to make room)<br>
Taken.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The &#8220;Invisiclues&#8221; hints of some of the 
reissued Infocom games sometimes included a category called 
&#8220;For Your Amusement&#8221;, listing some of the improbable 
things the game can do. Only the victorious should read this, as it 
might spoil surprises for anyone else. You can, optionally, provide 
such &#8220;amusing&#8221; information by defining the constant&#8230;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant AMUSING_PROVIDED;</pre>

<p class="normal">&#8230; and also providing an entry point routine 
called <code>Amusing</code>. For a player who has won the game, but 
not one who has merely died, the usual question</p>

<p class="output">Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game 
or QUIT?</p>

<p class="normal">will then become</p>

<p class="output">Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, 
see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT?</p>

<p class="normal">(The best way to provide such suggestions, if there 
are many, is to use a menu system like that described in 
<a href="s44.html">&#167;44</a>.) One of the worst-kept secrets of 
the Inform library is that an option not mentioned by this question 
is to type &#8220;undo&#8221;, which will undo the last move and restore 
the player to life. If you feel that this option should be mentioned, 
define the constant:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant DEATH_MENTION_UNDO;</pre>

<p class="normal">Finally, this end-of-game question will also mention 
the possibility of typing &#8220;full&#8221; to see a full score 
breakdown, if tasks are provided (see below).</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The other constants you are allowed to define help 
keep the score. There are two scoring systems provided by the library, 
side by side: you can use both or neither. You can always do what you 
like to the library's score variable in any case, though the &#8220;fullscore&#8221; 
verb might not then fully account for what's 
<a id="p172" name="p172"></a>
happened. Whatever scoring 
system you use, you should define <code>MAX_SCORE</code>, as
&#8216;Ruins&#8217; for instance does by declaring:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant MAX_SCORE = 30;</pre>

<p class="normal">This is the value which the library tells to the 
player as the maximum score attainable in text like:</p>

<p class="output">You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 30, 
in 1 turn.</p>

<p class="normal">Note that the library does <em>not</em> check 
that this is the actual maximum score it's possible to clock up: 
and nor does it cause the game to be automatically won if the 
maximum is achieved. The game is won when and only when <code>deadflag</code>
is set to 2 (see <a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a>), regardless of 
score.</p>

<p class="indent">The simpler scoring system awards points for the 
first time certain objects are picked up, and the first time certain 
places are entered. (As long as there is light to see by: no points 
unless you can recognise that you've arrived somewhere interesting.) 
To make an item or a place carry a points bonus, give it the attribute 
<code>scored</code>. You may also want to vary the amounts of these
bonuses by defining two constants:</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>OBJECT_SCORE</code>
points for picking up a scored object (normally 4);<br>
<code>ROOM_SCORE&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
points for entering a scored room (normally 5)</p>

<p class="normal">The more elaborate scoring system keeps track of 
which &#8220;tasks&#8221; the player has accomplished. These are 
only present if the constant <code>TASKS_PROVIDED</code> is 
defined, and then the further constant <code>NUMBER_TASKS</code> 
should indicate how many tasks have to be accomplished. If this value 
is <i>N</i>, then the tasks are numbered 0, 1, 2, &#8230;,
<i>N</i> &#8722; 1. The number of points gained by solving each
task must be defined in a <code>-&gt;</code> array with
<i>N</i> entries called <code>task_scores</code>, like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant TASKS_PROVIDED;
Constant NUMBER_TASKS = 5;
Constant MAX_SCORE = 25;
Array task_scores -&gt; 3 7 3 5 7;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Thus task 0 scores three points, task 1 scores seven 
points and so on. Since the entries in a <code>-&gt;</code> array have 
to be numbers between 0 and 255, no task can have a negative score 
or a score higher than 255. Besides a points score, each task has
a name, and these are printed by an entry point routine called 
<code>PrintTaskName</code>. For instance (&#8216;Toyshop&#8217;):</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<a id="p173" name="p173"></a>
<pre class="code">
[ PrintTaskName task_number;
  switch (task_number) {
      0: &quot;eating a sweet&quot;;
      1: &quot;driving the car&quot;;
      2: &quot;shutting out the draught&quot;;
      3: &quot;building a tower of four&quot;;
      4: &quot;seeing which way the mantelpiece leans&quot;;
  }
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">Finally, the game's source code should call 
<code>Achieved(task_number)</code> to tell the library that the 
given task has been completed. If this task has been completed
before, the library will do nothing: if not, the library will award 
the appropriate number of points. The verb &#8220;full&#8221; will 
give a full score breakdown including the achieved task in all 
future listings.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">When points are awarded by a call to <code>Achieved</code>, 
or by the player picking up a <code>scored</code> object, or visiting a 
<code>scored</code> place, or simply by the source code itself altering 
the <code>score</code> variable, no text is printed at the time. 
Instead, the library will normally notice at the end of the turn in 
question that the score has changed, and will print a message like:</p>

<p class="output">[Your score has gone up by three points.]</p>

<p class="normal">Not all players like this feature, so it can be turned 
on and off with the &#8220;notify&#8221; verb, but by default it is 
on. The designer can also turn the feature off and on: it is off 
if the library's variable <code>notify_mode</code> is <code>false</code>, 
on if it is <code>true</code>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Another (optional) entry point routine, called 
<code>PrintRank</code>, gets the chance to print text additional 
to the score. It's called <code>PrintRank</code> because the 
traditional &#8220;something additional&#8221; is a ranking based 
on the current score. Here is &#8216;Ruins&#8217;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ PrintRank;
  print &quot;, earning you the rank of &quot;;
  if (score == 30) &quot;Director of the Carnegie Institution.&quot;;
  if (score &gt;= 20) &quot;Archaeologist.&quot;;
  if (score &gt;= 10) &quot;Curiosity-seeker.&quot;;
  if (score &gt;= 5) &quot;Explorer.&quot;;
  &quot;Tourist.&quot;;
];
</pre>

<a id="p174" name="p174"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Besides the score breakdown, two more verbs are 
usually provided to the player: &#8220;objects&#8221; and &#8220;places&#8221;. 
The former lists off all the objects handled by the player and where 
they are now; the latter lists all the places visited by the player. 
In some game designs, these verbs will cause problems: you can get 
rid of them both by defining the constant <code>NO_PLACES</code>.</p>

<a id="ex57" name="ex57"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans57">EXERCISE 57</a></b></span><br>
Suppose one single room object is used internally for the 64 squares 
of a gigantic chessboard, each of which is a different location to 
the player. Then &#8220;places&#8221; is likely to result in only 
the last-visited square being listed. Fix this.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The rest of this section runs through some simple 
&#8220;special effects&#8221; which are often included in games. 
See <a href="ch7.html">Chapter VII</a> for much more on this, and 
in particular see <a href="s44.html">&#167;44</a> for using the 
<tt>&quot;Menus.h&quot;</tt> library extension.</p>

<p class="indent">The first effect is hardly special at all: to ask 
the player a yes/no question. To do this, print up the question 
and then call the library routine <code>YesOrNo</code>, which 
returns true/false accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">The status line is perhaps the most distinctive 
feature of Infocom games in play. This is the (usually highlighted) 
bar across the top of the screen. Usually, the game automatically 
prints the current game location, and either the time or the score 
and number of turns taken. It has the score/turns format unless
the directive</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Statusline time;</pre>

<p class="normal">has been written in the program, in which case the 
game's 24-hour clock is displayed. See <a href="s20.html">&#167;20</a> 
for more on time-keeping.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
If you want to change this, you need to <code>Replace</code> the 
parser's <code>DrawStatusLine</code> routine. This requires 
some assembly language programming: there are several examples 
of altered status lines in the exercises to <a href="s42.html">&#167;42</a>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Many games contain quotations, produced with <code>box</code> 
statements like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
box &quot;I might repeat to myself, slowly and soothingly,&quot;
    &quot;a list of quotations beautiful from minds profound;&quot;
    &quot;if I can remember any of the damn things.&quot;
    &quot;&quot;
    &quot;-- Dorothy Parker&quot;;
</pre>

<a id="p175" name="p175"></a>
<p class="normal">A snag with printing such boxes is that if you do it 
in the middle of a turn then it will probably scroll half-off the 
screen by the time the game finishes printing for the turn. The right 
time to do so is just after the prompt (usually &#8220;&gt;&#8221;) 
is printed, when the screen will definitely scroll no more. You 
could use the <code>Prompt:</code> slot in <code>LibraryMessages</code> 
to achieve this (see <a href="s25.html">&#167;25</a>), but a
more convenient way is to put your box-printing into the entry point 
routine <code>AfterPrompt</code>, which is called at this time in 
every turn.</p>

<a id="ex58" name="ex58"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans58">EXERCISE 58</a></b></span><br>
Devise a class <code>Quotation</code>, so that calling <code>QuoteFrom(Q)</code> 
for any quotation <code>Q</code> will cause it to be displayed at 
the end of the current turn, provided it hasn't been quoted before.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
&#8216;Advent&#8217; contains ranks and an <code>Amusing</code> reward 
(but doesn't use either of the scoring systems provided by the library, 
instead working by hand). &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>&#8216;Balances&#8217; uses 
<code>scored</code> objects (for its cubes). &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>&#8216;Toyshop&#8217; has 
tasks, as above. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>&#8216;Adventureland&#8217; 
uses its <code>TimePasses</code> entry point to recalculate the 
score every turn (and watch for victory).</p>

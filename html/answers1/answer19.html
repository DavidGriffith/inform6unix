<P>


Add the following lines, after the inclusion of <TT>Grammar</TT>:
<PRE>
[ SayInsteadSub; "[To talk to someone, please type ~someone, something~
or else ~ask someone about something~.]"; ];
Extend "answer" replace * topic -&#62; SayInstead;
Extend "tell"   replace * topic -&#62; SayInstead;
</PRE>

A slight snag is that this will throw out "nigel,
tell me about the grunfeld defence'' (which the library will normally
convert to an <TT>Ask</TT> action, but can't if the grammar for "tell'' is
missing).  To avoid this, you could (instead of making the above
directives) <TT>Replace</TT> the <TT>TellSub</TT> routine (see <A HREF="section21.html">Section 21</A>)
by the <TT>SayInsteadSub</TT> one.

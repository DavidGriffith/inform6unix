<h2>&#167;30 &nbsp; How verbs are parsed</h2>

<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;I can see that the grammar gets tucked into 
the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly.&#8221;<br>
&#8212; Louisa May Alcott (1832&#8211;1888), <i>Little Women</i></blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-225_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Here is how the parser reads in a whole command. Given a stream of 
text like</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>saint</tt> / <tt>peter</tt> / <tt>,</tt> / 
<tt>take</tt> / <tt>the</tt> / <tt>keys</tt> / <tt>from</tt> / 
<tt>paul</tt></p>

<p class="normal">it first breaks it into words, as shown, and then 
calls the entry point routine <code>BeforeParsing</code> (which you 
can provide, if you want to, in order to meddle with the text stream 
before parsing gets underway). The parser then works out who is being 
addressed, if anyone, by looking for a comma, and trying out the text 
up to there as a noun matching an <code>animate</code> or 
<code>talkable</code> object: in this case St Peter. This person is 
called the &#8220;actor&#8221;, since he or she is going to perform 
the action, and is most often the player (thus, typing &#8220;myself, 
go north&#8221; is equivalent to typing &#8220;go north&#8221;). 
The next word, in this case <code>'take'</code>, is the &#8220;verb 
word&#8221;. An Inform verb usually has several English verb words
attached, which are called synonyms of each other: for instance, the 
library is set up with</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8220;take&#8221; = &#8220;carry&#8221; 
= &#8220;hold&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">all referring to the same Inform verb.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The parser sets up variables <code>actor</code> and <code>verb_word</code> 
while working. (In the example above, their values would be the St Peter 
object and <code>'take'</code>, respectively.)</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
This brief discussion is simplified in two ways. Firstly, it leaves 
out directions, because Inform considers that the name of a direction-object 
implies &#8220;go&#8221;: thus &#8220;north&#8221; means &#8220;go 
north&#8221;. Secondly, it misses out the grammar property described 
in <a href="s18.html">&#167;18</a>, which can cause different actors 
to recognise different grammars.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans81">EXERCISE 81</a></b></span><br>
Use <code>BeforeParsing</code> to implement a lamp which, when rubbed, 
produces a genie who casts a spell to make the player confuse the 
words &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221;.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p226" name="p226"></a>
<p class="normal">This section is about verbs, which are defined 
with &#8220;grammar&#8221;, meaning usages of the directives <code>Verb</code> 
and <code>Extend</code>. The library contains a substantial amount
of grammar as it is, and this forms (most of) the library file 
<tt>&quot;Grammar.h&quot;</tt>. Grammar defined in your own code can 
either build on this or selectively knock it down, but either way it 
should be made after the inclusion of <tt>&quot;Grammar.h&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p class="indent">For instance, making a new synonym for an existing 
verb is easy:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'steal' 'acquire' 'grab' = 'take';</pre>

<p class="normal">Now &#8220;steal&#8221;, &#8220;acquire&#8221; and 
&#8220;grab&#8221; are synonyms for &#8220;take&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
One can also prise synonyms apart, as will appear later.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">To return to the text above, the parser has now 
recognised the English word &#8220;take&#8221; as one of those which 
can refer to a particular Inform verb. It has reached word 5 and still 
has &#8220;the keys from paul&#8221; left to understand.</p>

<p class="indent">Every Inform verb has a &#8220;grammar&#8221; which 
consists of a list of one or more &#8220;grammar lines&#8221;, each 
of them a pattern which the rest of the text might match. The parser 
tries the first, then the second and so on, and accepts the earliest 
one that matches, without ever considering later ones.</p>

<p class="indent">A line is a row of &#8220;tokens&#8221;. Typical 
tokens might mean &#8216;the name of a nearby object&#8217;, &#8216;the 
word <code>'from'</code>&#8217; or &#8216;somebody's name&#8217;. To 
match a line, the parser must match against each token in sequence. 
Continuing the example, the parser accepts the line of three tokens</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">one or more nouns</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">the word <tt>from</tt></span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">a noun</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">as matching &#8220;the keys from paul&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">Every grammar line has the name of an action attached, 
and in this case it is <code>Remove</code>: so the parser has ground 
up the original text into just four quantities, ending up with</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>actor = StPeter</tt> &nbsp;
<tt>action = Remove</tt> &nbsp; <tt>noun = gold_keys</tt> &nbsp;
<tt>second = StPaul</tt></p>

<p class="normal">The parser's job is now complete, and the rest of 
the Inform library can get on with processing the action or, as in 
this case, an order being addressed to somebody other than the player.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The action for the line currently being worked through is stored in 
the variable <code>action_to_be</code>; or, at earlier stages when 
the verb hasn't been deciphered yet, it holds the value <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<a id="p227" name="p227"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The <code>Verb</code> directive creates Inform 
verbs, giving them some English verb words and a grammar. The library's 
<tt>&quot;Grammar.h&quot;</tt> file consists almost exclusively of
<code>Verb</code> directives: here is an example simplified from one 
of them.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Verb 'take' 'get' 'carry' 'hold'
    * 'out'                   -&gt; Exit
    * multi                   -&gt; Take
    * multiinside 'from' noun -&gt; Remove
    * 'in' noun               -&gt; Enter
    * multiinside 'off' noun  -&gt; Remove
    * 'off' held              -&gt; Disrobe
    * 'inventory'             -&gt; Inv;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(You can look at the grammar being used in a game 
with the debugging verb &#8220;showverb&#8221;: see 
<a href="s7.html">&#167;7</a>.) Each line of grammar begins with a 
<code>*</code>, gives a list of tokens as far as <code>-&gt;</code> and 
then the action which the line produces. The first line can only be 
matched by something like &#8220;get out&#8221;, the second might 
be matched by</p>

<p class="output">&#8220;take the banana&#8221;<br>
&#8220;get all the fruit except the apple&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">and so on. A full list of tokens will be given 
later: briefly, <span class="grammartoken"><code>'out'</code></span> 
means the literal word &#8220;out&#8221;, <span class="grammartoken"><code>multi</code></span> 
means one or more objects nearby, <span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span> 
means just one and <span class="grammartoken"><code>multiinside</code></span> 
means one or more objects inside the second noun. In this book, grammar 
tokens are written in the style <span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span> 
to prevent confusion (as there is also a variable called <code>noun</code>).</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Some verbs are marked as <code>meta</code> &#8211; these are the verbs 
leading to Group 1 actions, those which are not really part of the 
game's world: for example, &#8220;save&#8221;, &#8220;score&#8221; 
and &#8220;quit&#8221;. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb meta 'score' * -&gt; Score;</pre>

<p class="aside">and any debugging verbs you create would probably work 
better this way, since meta-verbs are protected from interference by 
the game and take up no game time.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">After the <code>-&gt;</code> in each line is the 
name of an action. Giving a name in this way is what creates an action, 
and if you give the name of one which doesn't already 
<a id="p228" name="p228"></a>
exist then you 
must also write a routine to execute the action, even if it's one which 
doesn't do very much. The name of the routine is always the name of
the action with <code>Sub</code> appended. For instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ XyzzySub; &quot;Nothing happens.&quot;; ];
Verb 'xyzzy' * -&gt; Xyzzy;
</pre>

<p class="normal">will make a new magic-word verb &#8220;xyzzy&#8221;, 
which always says &#8220;Nothing happens&#8221; &#8211; always, that 
is, unless some before rule gets there first, as it might do in 
certain magic places. <code>Xyzzy</code> is now an action just as 
good as all the standard ones: <code>##Xyzzy</code> gives its action 
number, and you can write <code>before</code> rules for it in 
<code>Xyzzy:</code> fields just as you would for, say, <code>Take</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Finally, the line can end with the word <code>reverse</code>. This 
is only useful if there are objects or numbers in the line which 
occur in the wrong order. An example from the library's grammar:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Verb 'show' 'present' 'display'
    * creature held      -&gt; Show reverse
    * held 'to' creature -&gt; Show;
</pre>

<p class="aside">The point is that the <code>Show</code> action expects 
the first parameter to be an item, and the second to be a person. 
When the text &#8220;show him the shield&#8221; is typed in, the 
parser must reverse the two parameters &#8220;him&#8221; and 
&#8220;the shield&#8221; before causing a <code>Show</code> action.
On the other hand, in &#8220;show the shield to him&#8221; the 
parameters are in the right order already.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The library defines grammars for the 100 or so English 
verbs most often used by adventure games. However, in practice you 
quite often need to alter these, usually to add extra lines of grammar 
but sometimes to remove existing ones. For instance, suppose you 
would like &#8220;drop charges&#8221; to be a command in a
detection game (or a naval warfare game). This means adding a new 
grammar line to the &#8220;drop&#8221; verb. The <code>Extend</code> 
directive is provided for exactly this purpose:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Extend 'drop' * 'charges' -&gt; DropCharges;</pre>

<p class="normal">Normally, extra lines of grammar are added at the 
bottom of those already there, so that this will be the very last grammar 
line tested by the parser. This may not be what you want. For instance, 
&#8220;take&#8221; has a grammar line reading</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">* multi -&gt; Take</pre>

<a id="p229" name="p229"></a>
<p class="normal">quite early on. So if you want to add a grammar line 
diverting &#8220;take &#8249;<span class="token">food</span>&#8250;&#8221; to
a different action, like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">* edible -&gt; Eat</pre>

<p class="normal">(<span class="grammartoken"><code>edible</code></span> 
being a token matching anything which has the attribute <code>edible</code>)
then it's no good adding this at the bottom of the <code>Take</code> 
grammar, because the earlier line will always be matched first. What you 
need is for the new line to go in at the top, not the bottom:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Extend 'take' first
    * edible -&gt; Eat;
</pre>

<p class="normal">You might even want to throw away the old grammar completely, 
not just add a line or two. For this, use</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Extend 'press' replace
    * 'charges' -&gt; PressCharges;
</pre>

<p class="normal">and now the verb &#8220;press&#8221; has no other 
sense but this, and can't be used in the sense of pressing down on 
objects any more, because those grammar lines are gone. To sum 
up, <code>Extend</code> can optionally take one of three keywords:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td><code>replace</code></td><td>&nbsp; replace the old grammar with this one;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>first</code></td><td>&nbsp; insert the new grammar at the top;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>last</code></td><td>&nbsp; insert the new grammar at the bottom;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">with <code>last</code> being the default.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
In library grammar, some verbs have many synonyms: for instance,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
'attack' 'break' 'smash' 'hit' 'fight' 'wreck' 'crack'
'destroy' 'murder' 'kill' 'torture' 'punch' 'thump'
</pre>

<p class="aside">are all treated as identical. But you might want 
to distinguish between murder and lesser crimes. For this, try</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Extend only 'murder' 'kill' replace
    * animate -&gt; Murder;
</pre>

<p class="aside">The keyword only tells Inform to extract the two 
verbs &#8220;murder&quot; and &#8220;kill&quot;. These then become 
a new verb which is initially an identical copy of the old one, but 
then <code>replace</code> tells Inform to throw that away in favour of 
an entirely new grammar. Similarly,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Extend only 'run' * 'program' -&gt; Compute;</pre>

<p class="aside">makes &#8220;run&quot; behave exactly like &#8220;go&quot; 
and &#8220;walk&#8221;, as these three words are ordinarily synonymous 
to the library, except that it also recognises &#8220;program&quot;, 
so that &#8220;run program&quot; activates a computer but &#8220;walk 
program&quot; doesn't. Other good pairs to separate might be &#8220;cross&#8221; 
and &#8220;enter&#8221;, &#8220;drop&#8221; and &#8220;throw&#8221;, 
&#8220;give&#8221; and &#8220;feed&#8221;, &#8220;swim&#8221; 
and &#8220;dive&#8221;, &#8220;kiss&#8221; and &#8220;hug&#8221;, 
&#8220;cut&#8221; and &#8220;prune&#8221;. Bear in mind that once a
pair has been split apart like this, any subsequent change to one will 
not also change the other.</p>

<a id="p230" name="p230"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Occasionally verb definition commands are not enough. For example, 
in the original &#8216;Advent&#8217;, the player could type the name 
of an adjacent place which had previously been visited, and be taken 
there. (This feature isn't included in the Inform example version 
of the game in order to keep the source code as simple as possible.)
There are several laborious ways to code this, but here's a concise 
way. The library calls the <code>UnknownVerb</code> entry point routine 
(if you provide one) when the parser can't even get past the first 
word. This has two options: it can return <code>false</code>, in which 
case the parser just goes on to complain as it would have done anyway. 
Otherwise, it can return a verb word which is substituted for what 
the player actually typed. Here is one way the &#8216;Advent&#8217; 
room-naming might work. Suppose that every room has been given a 
property called <code>go_verb</code> listing the words which refer 
to it, so for instance the well house might be defined along these 
lines:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
AboveGround Inside_Building &quot;Inside Building&quot;
  with description
           &quot;You are inside a building, a well house for a
           large spring.&quot;,
       go_verb 'well' 'house' 'inside' 'building',
...
</pre>

<p class="aside">The <code>UnknownVerb</code> routine then looks 
through the possible compass directions for already-visited 
rooms, checking against words stored in this new property:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Global go_verb_direction;
[ UnknownVerb word room direction adjacent;
  room = real_location;
  objectloop (direction in compass) {
      adjacent = room.(direction.door_dir);
      if (adjacent ofclass Object &amp;&amp; adjacent has visited
          &amp;&amp; adjacent provides go_verb
          &amp;&amp; WordInProperty(word, adjacent, go_verb)) {
              go_verb_direction = direction;
              return 'go.verb';
      }
  }
  if (room provides go_verb
      &amp;&amp; WordInProperty(word, room, go_verb)) {
      go_verb_direction = &quot;You're already there!&quot;;
      return 'go.verb';
  }
  objectloop (room provides go_verb &amp;&amp; room has visited
              &amp;&amp; WordInProperty(word, room, go_verb)) {
      go_verb_direction = &quot;You can't get there from here!&quot;;
      return 'go.verb';
  }<a id="p231" name="p231"></a>
  objectloop (room provides go_verb &amp;&amp; room hasnt visited
              &amp;&amp; WordInProperty(word, room, go_verb)) {
      go_verb_direction = &quot;But you don't know the way there!&quot;;
      return 'go.verb';
  }
  rfalse;
];
</pre>

<p class="aside">When successful, this routine stores either a compass 
direction (an object belonging to the compass) in the variable 
<code>go_verb_direction</code>, or else a string to print. (Note that
an <code>UnknownVerb</code> routine shouldn't print anything itself, 
as this might be inappropriate in view of subsequent parsing, or if 
the actor isn't the player.) The routine then tells the parser to 
treat the verb as if it were <code>'go.verb'</code>, and as this doesn't 
exist yet, we must define it:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ Go_VerbSub;
  if (go_verb_direction ofclass String)
      print_ret (string) go_verb_direction;
  &lt;&lt;Go go_verb_direction&gt;&gt;;
];
Verb 'go.verb' * -&gt; Go_Verb;

A minor deficiency with the above system is that the parser may print 
out strange responses like &#8220;I only understood you as far as 
wanting to go.verb.&#8221; if the player types something odd 
like &#8220;bedquilt the nugget&#8221;. How can we ensure that the 
parser will always say something like &#8220;I only understood you

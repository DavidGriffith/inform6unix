<h2>&#167;16 &nbsp; Reading matter and consultation</h2>

&#8220;Look up figure 18 in the engineering textbook&#8221; is a 
difficult line for Inform to understand, because almost anything could 
appear in the first part: even its format depends on what the second 
part is. This kind of request, and more generally</p>

<p class="syntax">&gt;<tt>look up</tt> &#8249;<span class="token">any words here</span>&#8250; <tt>in</tt> &#8249;<span class="token">the object</span>&#8250;<br>
&gt;<tt>read about</tt> &#8249;<span class="token">any words here</span>&#8250; <tt>in</tt> &#8249;<span class="token">the object</span>&#8250;<br>

<p class="normal">cause the <code>Consult</code> action. In such cases, 
the <code>noun</code> is the book and there is no <code>second</code> 
object. Instead, the object has to parse the &#8249;<span class="token">any words here</span>&#8250; part 
itself. The following variables are set up to make this possible:</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>consult_from</code> holds the number of 
the first word in the &#8249;<span class="token">any&#8230</span>&#8250; clause;<br>
<code>consult_words</code> holds the number of words in the 
&#8249;<span class="token">any&#8230;</span>&#8250; clause.</p>

<p class="normal">The &#8249;<span class="token">any words here</span>&#8250; 
clause must contain at least one word. The words given can be parsed 
using library routines like <code>NextWord()</code>, 
<code>TryNumber(word-number)</code> and so on: see 
<a href="s28.html">&#167;28</a> for full details. As usual, the 
<code>before</code> routine should return <code>true</code> if it 
has managed to deal with the action; returning <code>false</code>
will make the library print &#8220;You discover nothing of interest 
in&#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">Little hints are placed here and there in the

To mark the 505th anniversary of William Tyndale, the first English 
translator of the New Testament (who was born some time around 
1495 and burned as a heretic in Vilvorde, Denmark, in 1535), prepare 
an Inform edition.</p>

Ordinarily, a request by the player to &#8220;read&#8221; something 
is translated into an <code>Examine</code> action. But the &#8220;read&#8221; 
verb is defined independently of the &#8220;examine&#8221; verb
in order to make it easy to separate the two requests. For instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Attribute legible;
...
Object textbook &quot;textbook&quot;
  with name 'engineering' 'textbook' 'text' 'book',
       description &quot;What beautiful covers and spine!&quot;,<a id="p143" name="p143"></a>
       before [;
           Consult, Read:
               &quot;The pages are full of senseless equations.&quot;;
       ],
  has  legible;
...
[ ReadSub;
  &lt;&lt;Examine noun&gt;&gt;; 
];
Extend 'read' first * legible -&gt; Read;
</pre>

<p class="aside">Note that &#8220;read&#8221; causes a <code>Read</code> 
action only for <code>legible</code> objects, and otherwise causes
<code>Examine</code> in the usual way. <code>ReadSub</code> is coded 
as a translation to <code>Examine</code> as well, so that
if a <code>legible</code> object doesn't provide a <code>Read</code> 
rule then an <code>Examine</code> happens after all.</p>

Another possibility for parsing commands like &#8220;look up &#8249;<span class="token">something</span>&#8250; 
in the catalogue&#8221;, where any object name might appear as the 
&#8249;<span class="token">something</span>&#8250;, would be to extend the grammar 
for &#8220;look&#8221;. See <a href="s30.html">&#167;30</a>.</p>

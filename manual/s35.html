<h2>&#167;35 &nbsp; Case and parsing noun phrases</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-262_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
As this section and the next use a variety of linguistic terms, here
are some definitions. &#8220;Flexion&#8221; is the changing of a word 
according to its situation, and there are several kinds:</p>

<p class="aside"><em>inflection</em>: a variable ending for a word, 
such as &#8220;a&#8221; becoming &#8220;an&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><em>agreement</em>: when the inflection of one 
word is changed to match another word which it goes with. Thus 
&#8220;grand maison&#8221; but &#8220;grande dame&#8221; (French), 
where the inflection on &#8220;grand&#8221; agrees with the gender 
of the noun it is being applied to.</p>

<p class="aside"><em>affix</em>: part of a word which is attached 
either at the beginning (<em>prefix</em>), the end (<em>suffix</em>)
or somewhere in the middle (<em>infix</em>) of the ordinary word 
(the <em>stem</em>) to indicate, for instance, person or gender of 
the objects attached to a verb. The affix often plays a part that 
an entirely separate word would play in English. For instance, 
&#8220;donnez-lui&#8221; (French: &#8220;give to him&#8221;), where 
the suffix is &#8220;-lui&#8221;, or &#8220;cogela&#8221; (Spanish: 
&#8220;take it&#8221;), where the suffix is &#8220;la&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><em>enclitic</em>: an affix, usually a suffix, meaning 
&#8220;too&#8221; or &#8220;and&#8221; in English. For instance,
&#8220;que&#8221; (Latin).</p>

<p class="aside"><em>agglutinization</em>: the practice of composing many 
affixes to a single word, so that it may even become an entire phrase. 
For instance:</p>

<p class="syntax">kirjoitettuasi &nbsp; <i>after you had written</i> 
(Finnish)</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In most languages, noun phrases have different
<em>cases</em> according to their situation in a sentence. In the 
English sentence &#8220;Emily ate one bath bun and gave Beatrice 
the other&#8221;, the noun phrase &#8220;Emily&#8221; is <em>nominative</em>, 
&#8220;one bath bun&#8221; and &#8220;the other&#8221; are 
<em>accusative</em> and &#8220;Beatrice&#8221; is <em>dative</em>. 
These last two are the cases most often occurring in Inform commands, 
as in the example</p>

<p class="syntax">leg den frosch auf ihn &nbsp; <i>put the frog 
on him</i> (German)<br>
nimm den frosch von ihm &nbsp; <i>take the frog from him</i></p>

<p class="normal">where the noun phrase &#8220;den frosch&#8221; is 
accusative both times, but &#8220;ihn&#8221; and &#8220;ihm&#8221; 
are the same word (&#8220;him&#8221;) in its accusative and dative 
forms. In some languages a <em>vocative</em> case would also be needed 
for the name of someone being addressed:</p>

<p class="syntax">domine, fiat lux &nbsp; <i>Lord, let there be light</i> 
(Latin)</p>

<a id="p263" name="p264"></a>
<p class="normal">since &#8220;domine&#8221; is the vocative form of 
&#8220;dominus&#8221;. Latin also has genitive and ablative cases, 
making six in all, but this pales by comparison with Finnish, which 
has about thirty. In effect, a wide range of English prepositional phrases
like &#8220;into the water&#8221; are written as just the noun phrase 
&#8220;water&#8221; with a suffix meaning &#8220;into&#8221;.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">To parse any of these languages, and even in some 
circumstances to parse special effects in English-language games, 
it's useful to have further control over the way that the parser 
recognises noun phrases.</p>

<p class="indent">The words entered into an object's <code>name</code> property 
normally take the accusative case, the one most often needed in commands, 
as for example in the grammar line:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'take' * noun -&gt; Take;</pre>

<p class="normal">On the other hand, the nouns in the following grammar 
lines aren't all accusative:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Verb 'give'
    * noun 'to' noun -&gt; Give
    * noun noun      -&gt; Give reverse;
</pre>

<p class="normal">This matches &#8220;give biscuit to jemima&#8221; and 
&#8220;give jemima biscuit&#8221;, &#8220;biscuit&#8221; being accusative 
in both cases and &#8220;to jemima&#8221; and &#8220;jemima&#8221; both 
dative. In a language where the spelling of a word can tell a dative 
from an accusative, such as German, we could instead use grammar like 
this:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Verb 'give'
    * noun dativenoun -&gt; Give
    * dativenoun noun -&gt; Give reverse;
</pre>

<p class="normal">where <span class="grammartoken"><code>dativenoun</code></span> 
is some token meaning &#8220;like <span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span>, 
but in the dative case instead of the accusative&#8221;. This could 
be used as the definition of a German verb &#8220;gib&#8221;, in which 
case both of the following would be parsed correctly:</p>

<p class="syntax">gib die blumen dem maedchen &nbsp; <i>give 
the flowers to the girl</i><br>
gib dem maedchen die blumen &nbsp; <i>give the girl the flowers</i></p>

<p class="normal">Unfortunately Inform doesn't come with a token called 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>dativenoun</code></span> built in,
so you have to write one, using a general parsing routine (see 
<a href="s31.html">&#167;31</a>). For the sake 
<a id="p264" name="p264"></a>
of an example closer 
to English, suppose a puzzle in which the Anglo-Saxon hero Beowulf will 
do as he is asked to, but only if addressed in Old English:</p>

<p class="syntax">beowulf, gief gold to cyning &nbsp;
<i>beowulf, give gold to king</i> (Old English)</p>

<p class="normal">The grammar would be much like that for German, 
and indeed English:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'gief' * noun dativenoun -&gt; OEGive;</pre>

<p class="normal">and here is a simple version of 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>dativenoun</code></span>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ dativenoun;
  if (NextWord() == 'to')
      return ParseToken(ELEMENTARY_TT, NOUN_TOKEN);
  return GPR_FAIL;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">Read this as: &#8220;if the next word is &#8220;to&#8221;, 
try and match a noun following it; otherwise it isn't a dative&#8221;. 
A more likely form of the command is however</p>

<p class="syntax">beowulf, gief gold cyninge &nbsp;
<i>beowulf, give gold to king</i> (Old English)</p>

<p class="normal">where &#8220;cyninge&#8221; is the dative form of 
&#8220;cyning&#8221;. The ending &#8220;-e&#8221; often indicates a 
dative in Old English, but there are irregularities, such as &#8220;searo&#8221;
(device), whose dative is &#8220;searwe&#8221;, not &#8220;searoe&#8221;. 
In the unlikely event of Beowulf confronting a vending machine:</p>

<p class="syntax">beowulf, gief gold to searo &nbsp;
<i>beowulf, give gold to device</i> (Old English)<br>
beowulf, gief gold searwe &nbsp; <i>beowulf, give gold to device</i></p>

<p class="normal">How to manage all this? Here is a laborious way:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; &quot;searo&quot;
  with name 'searo', dativename 'searwe';
Object -&gt; &quot;Cyning&quot;
  with name 'cyning', dativename 'cyninge';
[ dativenoun;
  if (NextWord() ~= 'to') {
      wn--; parser_inflection = dativename;
  }
  return ParseToken(ELEMENTARY_TT, NOUN_TOKEN);
];
</pre>

<a id="p265" name="p265"></a>
<p class="normal">The variable <code>parser_inflection</code> tells 
the parser where to find the name(s) of an object. It must always be 
equal to <em>either</em> a property <em>or</em> a routine. Most of the
time it's equal to the property <code>name</code>, the accusative case 
as normal. If it equals another property, such as <code>dativename</code>, 
then the parser looks in that property for name-words instead of in 
<code>name</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">The above solution is laborious because it makes 
the game designer write out dative forms of every name, even though they 
are very often the same but with &#8220;-e&#8221; suffixed. It's for 
this kind of contingency that <code>parser_inflection</code> can be 
set to a routine name. Such an &#8220;inflection routine&#8221; is 
called with two arguments: an object and a dictionary word. It returns 
<code>true</code> if the dictionary word can mean the object and 
<code>false</code> if not. The word number <code>wn</code> is always
set to the number of the next word along, and it should not be moved. 
Two library routines may be particularly helpful:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">DictionaryLookup(text, length)</pre>

<p class="normal">returns 0 if the word held as a <code>-&gt;</code> 
array of characters</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">text-&gt;0, text-&gt;1, ..., text-&gt;(length-1)</pre>

<p class="normal">is not in the game's dictionary, or its dictionary 
entry if it is.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">WordInProperty(word, object, property)</pre>

<p class="normal">to see if this is one of the words listed in 
<code>object.property</code>. It may also be useful to know that the 
variable <code>indef_mode</code> is always set to <code>true</code> when 
parsing something known to be indefinite (e.g., because an indefinite 
article or a word like &#8220;all&#8221; has just been typed), and 
<code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<a id="ex107" name="ex107"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans107">EXERCISE 107</a></b></span><br>
Rewrite the <code>dativenoun</code> token so that &#8220;-e&#8221; 
is recognised as a regular suffix indicating the dative, while still 
making provision for some nouns to have irregular dative forms.</p>

<a id="ex108" name="ex108"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans108">EXERCISE 108</a></b></span><br>
Now add an (imaginary, not Old English) dative pronominal adverb 
&#8220;toit&#8221;, which is to be understood as &#8220;to it&#8221;.</p>

<a id="ex109" name="ex109"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans109">EXERCISE 109</a></b></span><br>
Define a token <span class="grammartoken"><code>swedishnoun</code></span> 
to make nouns and adjectives agree with the article (definite or 
indefinite) applied to them, so for instance:</p>

<p class="syntax">en brun hund &nbsp; <i>a brown dog</i> (Swedish)<br>
den bruna hunden &nbsp; <i>the brown dog</i><br>
ett brunt hus &nbsp; <i>a brown house</i><br>
det bruna huset &nbsp; <i>the brown house</i></p>

<a id="p266" name="p266"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
The use of grammar tokens is only one way of dealing with flexion 
and pronominal adverbs. The alternative is to alter the text typed 
until it resembles normal Informese:</p>

<p class="syntax">gief gold cyninge &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; gief gold to cyning<br>
gief gold toit &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; gief gold to it<br>
den bruna hunden &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; den brun hund<br>
det bruna huset &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; det brun hus</p>

<p class="aside">See <a href="s36.html">&#167;36</a> below. In a 
heavily inflected language with many irregularities, a combination
of the two techniques may be needed.</p>

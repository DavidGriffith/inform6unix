<h2>&#167;51 &nbsp; The room description</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-406_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
When beginning to code a design, it is tempting to give rooms temporary 
descriptions (&#8220;Slab room.&#8221; &#8220;Cloister.&#8221;), and 
leave the writing for later. There is no more depressing point than 
facing a pile of 50 room descriptions to write, all at once, and feeling
that one's enthusiasm has altogether gone. (The same applies to making 
an over-detailed design before doing any coding.) Besides, when testing 
the rooms concerned, one has no feeling of what the game will look like 
except tatty, and this is also depressing. Also, writing room descriptions 
forces the designer to think about what the room is ultimately for. 
So most designers like to write a few at a time, as coding goes on, 
but to write them properly: and edit later for consistency and second 
thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">In any room description there are usually one to 
three essentials to get across, and the rest is better cut or relegated 
to text appearing only if the player chooses to examine something in 
particular. Even the most tedious junctions deserve description, 
however, and description is more than a list of exits. Here is 
&#8216;Advent&#8217; at its most graceful:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Shell Room</em><br>
You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock. The floor and 
walls are littered with bits of shells embedded in the stone. A 
shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads 
up. A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.<br>
<em>In Limestone Passage</em><br>
You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with 
oddly shaped limestone formations.</p>

<p class="normal">Note the geology, the slight unevenness of the ground 
and the variation in the size of the tunnels. Nothing happens here, 
but it seems a real place.</p>

<p class="indent">Flippant room descriptions are best avoided if they 
will be often revisited. Subtler humour is more durable:</p>

<p class="output">On the wall by the bed is a slightly curved, full-length 
mirror. You reflect upon this for a while.</p>

<p class="normal">(From the Cambridge University game 
&#8216;Xenophobia&#8217; (Jonathan Mestel, 1989). This wording is also 
neat in that it applies equally well on the tenth visit to a location 
as on the first, whereas text like &#8220;Astonished to see a mirror, 
you leap back&#8230;&#8221; would not.) About once in a game an author 
can get away with something like this:</p>

<a id="p407" name="p407"></a>
<p class="output"><em>Observation Room</em><br>
Calvin Coolidge once described windows as &#8220;rectangles of 
glass.&#8221; If so, he may have been thinking about the window which 
fills the western wall of this room. A tiny closet lies to the north. 
A sign is posted next to the stairs which lead both upwards and 
downwards.</p>

<p class="normal">A characteristic piece of Steve Meretzky<a id="s51_fnref1"
name="s51_fnref1"></a><a href="#s51_fn1">&#8224;</a> from &#8216;Leather 
Goddesses of Phobos&#8217;, demonstrating the lengths one has to go 
to when faced with a relentlessly ordinary junction-with-window. The 
sentence Meretzky is at pains to avoid is &#8220;You can go up, down 
or north.&#8221; With care it is even possible to remove mention 
of a room's exits altogether, but only if the information is presented
in some other way. For instance:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Dark Cave</em><br>
Little light seeps into this muddy, bone-scattered cave and always you 
long for fresh air. Strange bubbles, pulsing and shifting as if alive, 
hang upon the rock at crazy, irregular angles.<br>
Black crabs scuttle about your feet.<br>
&gt;<tt>south</tt><br>
The only exit is back out north to the sea-shore.</p>

<p class="normal">Here, the &#8220;You can't go that way&#8221; message 
for the room has taken up the slack.</p>

<p class="indent">Experienced players know all of the various formulae 
used in room descriptions by heart: &#8220;You're in&#8221;, &#8220;You 
are in&#8221;, &#8220;This is&#8221;, &#8220;You have come to&#8221; 
and so forth. This, perhaps, is why some designers prefer impersonal room 
descriptions, not mentioning &#8220;you&#8221; unless to say something 
other than the obvious fact of being present. Once into the text then, 
as in all writing, vocabulary counts. If there is a tree, of what species? 
If a chair, of what style? (&#8216;Cutthroats&#8217; (Mike Berlyn and 
Jerry Wolper, 1984) describes a cupboard of no particular interest as 
a &#8220;lopsided wooden dresser&#8221; for the sake of painting the 
scene.) Room descriptions should not always describe static, fixed 
things, should bring in senses other than sight and should not always 
be monochrome. Plainness and repetition are to be avoided at almost 
any cost:</p>

<p class="output">You're on a winding drive outside a magnificent door. 
Exits are west to a woodshed, upwards to a vine and in through a door. 
You can see a vine.<br>
&gt;<tt>west</tt><br><a id="p408" name="p408"></a>
You're in a woodshed in the swamp. Exits are east to a winding drive 
and west to a herb garden. You can see a candle and a woodpile.</p>

<p class="normal">(&#8216;The Price of Magik&#8217;, BBC Micro version 
&#8211; in the Amiga version of the later &#8216;Time and Magik Trilogy&#8217; 
re-release, the winding drive description ran to an eighty-word essay, 
and did away entirely with the mechanically-generated &#8220;exits 
are&#8221; sentence.) So much for what is bad. The following, from 
&#8216;Advent&#8217; again, is something much more dangerous: the 
mediocre room description.</p>

<p class="output"><em>Whirlpool Room</em><br>
You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades 
over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears 
through a hole in the floor. Passages exit to the south and west.</p>

<p class="normal">This seems a decent enough try, but no novelist would 
write like this. Each important noun &#8211; &#8220;cavern&#8221;, 
&#8220;stream&#8221;, &#8220;waterfall&#8221;, &#8220;whirlpool&#8221; 
&#8211; has its own adjective &#8211; &#8220;magnificent&#8221;, 
&#8220;rushing&#8221;, &#8220;sparkling&#8221;, &#8220;roaring&#8221;. 
The two &#8220;which&#8221; clauses in a row are a little unhappy. 
&#8220;Cascades&#8221; is good, but does a stream cascade &#8220;over&#8221; 
a waterfall? Does a whirlpool itself disappear? The &#8220;hole in 
the floor&#8221; seems incongruous. Surely it must be underwater, indeed
deep underwater? Come to that, the geography could be better used, 
which would also help to place the whirlpool within the cave (is 
it in the middle? on one edge?). And why &#8220;Whirlpool Room&#8221;, 
which sounds like one of the perks of a health club? Here is a second 
draft:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Whirlpool Ledge</em><br>
The path runs a quarter-circle from south to west around a broken ledge
of this funnel cavern. A waterfall drops out of the darkness, catching 
the lamplight as it cascades into the basin. Rapid currents whip into 
a roaring whirlpool below.</p>

<p class="normal">Even so, there is nothing man-made, nothing alive, no 
colour and besides it seems to miss the essential feature of all the 
mountain water-caves I've ever been to, so let us add a second paragraph 
(with a line break, which is easier on the eye):</p>

<p class="output">Blue-green algae hangs in clusters from the old 
guard-railing, which has almost rusted clean through in the frigid, 
soaking air.</p>

<p class="normal">The algae and the guard-rail offer possibilities. 
Perhaps there are frogs who could eat insect-eggs in the algae, or 
perhaps the player might find a use for iron oxide, and could scrape 
rust from the railing. Certainly the railing should break if 
a rope is tied to it. Is it safe to dive in? Does the water have a 
hypnotic effect on someone staring into it? Is there anything dry 
which would become damp if the player brought it through here? Might 
there be a second ledge higher up where the stream falls into the cave?</p>

<a id="p409" name="p409"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Lack of variety comes in many forms. Brian Howarth's eleven 
&#8220;Mysterious Adventures&#8221; games written for the Scott Adams 
game engine invent some interesting milieux (&#8216;Feasibility 
Experiment&#8217; (1982), with objects like &#8220;Vague Shapes&#8221;, 
is worth a look) but they are highly repetitive and difficult to tell 
apart. The main weakness of &#8216;Enchanter&#8217; is a sparse, 
location-heavy map, especially in the prologue, where many rooms 
over-describe their neighbours. Slightly at odds with the traditional 
dungeon elsewhere, &#8216;Enchanter&#8217; blends in horror tableaux: 
dead grass &#8220;seems to grip at your feet&#8221;, a demon statue 
&#8220;seems to reach towards you&#8221;. There's a lot of 
&#8220;seeming&#8221; motion, because the deserted, blasted landscape 
is largely static: &#8220;listless waves barely stir the flotsam and 
jetsam&#8221; sums it up only too well. The outcome would have been 
mediocre had the puzzles in the game not been exceptionally good, 
and a few of the interior locations appealing. Here is a fine example 
of the interior room as vista, overlooking a landscape and drawing 
together the whole game's map:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Map Room</em><br>
This room in the high tower appears to be a map room, with hundreds of
ancient maps covering the walls. A huge globe, made of gold, sits on 
a pedestal in the center of the room. Through the tower windows can 
be seen a vast forest stretching out to the northeast and the sea, 
covered in fog, to the east and south. Stairs to the south lead to 
the bottom of the tower.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">It is a vexed question just how much land occupies a 
single location. Usually a location represents a single room, perhaps 
ten yards across at the most. Really large chambers are usually given 
several locations, so that a ballroom might be divided into corners 
with names like &#8220;Ballroom Northwest&#8221; and &#8220;Ballroom
Southwest&#8221;. The &#8220;huge cave about 3,000 feet across&#8221; 
of &#8216;Acheton&#8217; occupies no less than 16 locations, which 
although it conveys a sense of space can also seem repetitious and 
wasteful.</p>

<p class="indent">At the other extreme it is sometimes necessary for 
a single location to do duty for a great swathe of ground, especially 
out of doors, where drawing the map can leave one with the same 
frustration as the set-designer for a Wagnerian opera: everything 
indistinct and without edges. &#8216;Spellbreaker&#8217;, under 
tight constraints on locations, includes one-location meadows and 
volcanos. The reverse position is taken by the distinctive and plausible 
&#8216;Gateway to Karos&#8217; (Derek Haslam, 1984). Locations are 
superimposed in a square map-like grid onto the rivers, cliffs, forest 
and so forth of the island of Karos, so that each location represents 
perhaps one square kilometer:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Eastlands</em><br>
You are in a cluster of roofless, abandoned buildings, apparently 
part of an ore-washing mill. A dry water-channel runs northward, and 
a path leads west.<br><a id="p410" name="p410"></a>
A garden spade, well used but still strong and sharp, lies abandoned here.</p>

<p class="normal">(About a dozen neighbouring locations share the short 
name &#8220;Eastlands&#8221;.) A middle position between &#8216;Spellbreaker&#8217; 
and &#8216;Gateway to Karos&#8217; is taken by &#8216;She's Got a Thing 
For a Spring&#8217; (1997), an evocation by the nature photographer 
Brent VanFossen of the mountains of northwest America. Almost an 
interactive postcard, this thoroughly appealing game features elks, 
mooses, eagles and so forth, but is equally vivid with terrain and 
vegetation:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Granite Canyon</em><br>
You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by 
the nearby stream and 20 or 30 feet deep. A rocky path enters from the 
west beside a tangle of blackberries, and dead ends at a ledge overlooking 
the stream below. Above you, granite walls continue to rise, the pink 
stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An animal trail leads 
up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to make it in a scramble.<br>
Beside you stands a small tower supporting one end of a steel cable.<br>
The end of a spruce branch is just barely visible deep inside the 
blackberries.</p>

<p class="normal">A single location can also substitute for an infinite 
expanse, such as the Neverending Lane of &#8216;Jinxter&#8217;.</p>

<p class="indent">Another consideration in outdoor locations is that 
the slow process of sunrise and sunset ought to affect room descriptions. 
&#8216;Christminster&#8217; organises time so as to keep the player indoors 
between seven and ten p.m. so that only two states are needed, full day 
and full night. &#8216;A Mind Forever Voyaging&#8217; derives most 
of its impact from its depiction of the same city decaying in ten-year 
stages, as it rolls forward in history like H. G. Wells's classic (and
classically filmed) novel <i>Things To Come</i>. The definitive 
shifting-description game of recent years is Andrew Plotkin's &#8216;A 
Change in the Weather&#8217; (1995):</p>

<p class="output">You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown 
hillface. Greenery hides the stream below and the hilltop above, and 
the meadows and sky beyond sweep away into the incandescent west.</p>

<p class="output">You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown 
hillface. Rain hides the stream below and the hilltop above, and to the west 
is only dark.</p>

<p class="normal">Descriptions alter not just through time passing, but 
also because of differences in perspective. Still the most remarkable 
example is the &#8216;Suspended&#8217; complex, which a player in suspended 
animation controls through robots with different sensory perceptions. 
Here is the same place from four points of view:</p>

<p class="output">I'm in a large room which looks like the inside of 
a globe. The walls seem sculptured with wiring, swirling around the 
room's perimeter, leading into a tall column. The column itself has 
a door on its face. Doorways lead to the west, south, east and northeast.</p>

<a id="p411" name="p411"></a>
<p class="output">Sonar indicates a large, spherical open area with a hollow column running
from floor to ceiling. The column reflects sonar evenly indicating 
no distinguishing external characteristics.</p>

<p class="output">All around me charges flow, shaped by the very nature of this room. The
electrons are being channeled into an electrical column, central to this
environment.</p>

<p class="output">A small humming can be detected from a column which extends from floor
to ceiling.</p>

<p class="normal">Another device, used in the spy thriller &#8216;Border 
Zone&#8217; (Marc Blank, 1987), is to respond to directions not with 
a description of the new location but with a response about how you got 
there:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>east</tt><br>
You open the door and walk out into the passageway. You scan the
passageway, noting guards at either end, machine guns poised at their 
sides. You don't remember them from the beginning of the trip, so you 
can only suppose that security has been tightened in the search for 
the American agent.<br>
&gt;<tt>look</tt><br>
<em>Outside Your Compartment</em><br>
You are standing in the passageway that runs along the length of the 
car. At either end of the passageway, a guard is standing, machine gun 
poised at his side. Right now, you're standing outside your own 
compartment.</p>

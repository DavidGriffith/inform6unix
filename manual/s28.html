<blockquote>The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,<br>
It isn't just one of your holiday games;<br>
You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter<br>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-216_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Suppose we have a tomato defined with</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">name 'fried' 'green' 'tomato',</pre>

<p class="normal">but which is going to redden later and need to be 
referred to as &#8220;red tomato&#8221;. The <code>name</code> property 
holds an array of dictionary words, so that</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
(tomato.#name)/2 == 3
tomato.&amp;name--&gt;0 == 'fried'
tomato.&amp;name--&gt;1 == 'green'
tomato.&amp;name--&gt;2 == 'tomato'
</pre>

<p class="normal">(Recall that <code>X.#Y</code> tells you the number of 
<code>-&gt;</code> entries in such a property array, in this case six, 
so that <code>X.#Y/2</code> tells you the number of <code>--&gt;</code> 
entries, in this case three.) You are quite free to alter this array 
during play:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">tomato.&amp;name--&gt;1 = 'red';</pre>

<p class="normal">The down side of this technique is that it's clumsy, 
when all's said and done, and not so very flexible, because you can't 
change the length of the <code>tomato.&amp;name</code> array during 
play. Of course you <em>could</em> define the tomato</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
with name 'fried' 'green' 'tomato' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.'
          'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.'
          'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.' 'blank.',
</pre>

<p class="normal">or something similar, giving yourself another (say) 
fifteen &#8220;slots&#8221; to put new names into, but this is 
inelegant even by Inform standards. Instead, an object like the tomato 
can be given a <code>parse_name</code> routine, allowing complete flexibility
for the designer to specify just what names it does and doesn't match. 
It is time to begin looking into the parser and how it works.</p>

<a id="p217" name="p217"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The Inform parser has two cardinal principles: 
firstly, it is designed to be as &#8220;open-access&#8221; as possible, 
because a parser cannot ever be general enough for every game without 
being highly modifiable. This means that there are many levels on 
which you can augment or override what it does. Secondly, it tries
to be generous in what it accepts from the player, understanding the 
broadest possible range of commands and making no effort to be strict 
in rejecting ungrammatical requests. For instance, given a shallow 
pool nearby, &#8220;examine shallow&#8221; has an adjective without 
a noun: but it's clear what the player means. In general, all sensible 
commands should be accepted but it is not important whether or not 
nonsensical ones are rejected.</p>

<p class="indent">The first thing the parser does is to read in text 
from the keyboard and break it up into a stream of words: so the text 
&#8220;wizened man, eat the grey bread&#8221; becomes</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>wizened</tt> / <tt>man</tt> / <tt>,</tt> / 
<tt>eat</tt> / <tt>the</tt> / <tt>grey</tt> / <tt>bread</tt></p>

<p class="normal">and these words are numbered from 1. At all times 
the parser keeps a &#8220;word number&#8221; marker to keep its place 
along this line, and this is held in the variable <code>wn</code>. 
The routine <code>NextWord()</code> returns the word at the current 
position of the marker, and moves it forward, i.e., adds 1 to <code>wn</code>. 
For instance, the parser may find itself at word 6 and trying to 
match &#8220;grey bread&#8221; as the name of an object. Calling 
<code>NextWord()</code> returns the value <code>'grey'</code> and 
calling it again gives <code>'bread'</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">Note that if the player had mistyped &#8220;grye bread&#8221;, 
&#8220;grye&#8221; being a word which isn't mentioned anywhere in the 
program or created by the library, then <code>NextWord()</code> returns 
0 for &#8216;not in the dictionary&#8217;. Inform creates the dictionary 
of a story file by taking all the <code>name</code> words of objects, all 
the verbs and prepositions from grammar lines, and all the words used 
in constants like <code>'frog'</code> written in the source code, 
and then sorting these into alphabetical order.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
However, the story file's dictionary only has 9-character resolution. 
(And only 6 if Inform has been told to compile an early-model story 
file: see <a href="s45.html">&#167;45</a>.) Thus the values of 
<code>'polyunsaturate'</code> and <code>'polyunsaturated'</code> 
are equal. Also, upper case and lower case letters are considered the 
same. Although dictionary words are permitted to contain numerals 
or typewriter symbols like <code>-</code>, <code>:</code> or 
<code>/</code>, these cost as much as two ordinary letters, so 
<code>'catch-22'</code> looks the same as <code>'catch-2'</code> or 
<code>'catch-207'</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
A dictionary word can even contain spaces, full stops or commas, but 
if so it is &#8216;untypeable&#8217;. For instance, <code>'in,out'</code> 
is an untypeable word because if the player were to type something 
like &#8220;go in,out&#8221;, the text would be broken up into four 
words, <code>go</code> / 
<a id="p218" name="p218"></a>
<code>in</code> / <code>,</code> / <code>out</code>. 
Thus <code>'in,out'</code> may be in the story file's dictionary but 
it will never match against any word of what the player typed. Surprisingly, 
this can be useful, as it was at the end of <a href="s18.html">&#167;18</a>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Since the story file's dictionary isn't always perfect, 
there is sometimes no alternative but to actually look at the player's 
text one character at a time: for instance, to check that a 12-digit 
phone number has been typed correctly and in full.</p>

<p class="indent">The routine <code>WordAddress(wordnum)</code> returns 
a byte array of the characters in the word, and <code>WordLength(wordnum)</code> 
tells you how many characters there are in it. Given the above example 
text of &#8220;wizened man, eat the grey bread&#8221;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
WordLength(4) == 3
WordAddress(4)-&gt;0 == 'e'
WordAddress(4)-&gt;1 == 'a'
WordAddress(4)-&gt;2 == 't'
</pre>

<p class="normal">because word number 4 is &#8220;eat&#8221;. (Recall 
that the comma is considered as a word in its own right.)</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The parser provides a basic routine for comparing a word against the 
texts <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code>, <code>'2'</code>, &#8230;, 
<code>'9999'</code>, <code>'10000'</code> or, in other words, against 
small numbers. This is the library routine <code>TryNumber(wordnum)</code>, 
which tries to parse the word at <code>wordnum</code> as a number and 
returns that number, if it finds a match. Besides numbers written 
out in digits, it also recognises the texts <code>'one'</code>, 
<code>'two'</code>, <code>'three'</code>, &#8230;, <code>'twenty'</code>. 
If it fails to recognise the text as a number, it returns &#8722;1,000; 
if it finds a number greater than 10,000, it rounds down and returns 
10,000.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">To return to the naming of objects, the parser normally 
recognises any arrangement of some or all of the <code>name</code> words of an 
object as a noun which refers to it: and the more words, the better the 
match is considered to be. Thus &#8220;fried green tomato&#8221; is 
a better match than &#8220;fried tomato&#8221; or &#8220;green tomato&#8221; 
but all three are considered to match. On the other hand, so is 
&#8220;fried green&#8221;, and &#8220;green green tomato green fried 
green&#8221; is considered a very good match indeed. The method is quick 
and good at understanding a wide variety of sensible texts, though 
poor at throwing out foolish ones. (An example of the parser's strategy 
of being generous rather than strict.) To be more precise, here is what 
happens when the parser wants to match some text against an object:</p>

<a id="p219" name="p219"></a>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>If the object provides a <code>parse_name</code> routine, ask 
this routine to determine how good a match there is.</li>
<li>If there was no <code>parse_name</code> routine, or if there was 
but it returned &#8722;1, ask the entry point routine <code>ParseNoun</code>, 
if the game has one, to make the decision.</li>
<li>If there was no <code>ParseNoun</code> entry point, or if there 
was but it returned &#8722;1, look at the <code>name</code> of the object 
and match the longest possible sequence of words given in the <code>name</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="normal">So: a <code>parse_name</code> routine, if provided, 
is expected to try to match as many words as possible starting from 
the current position of <code>wn</code> and reading them in one at 
a time using the <code>NextWord()</code> routine. Thus it must not stop 
just because the first word makes sense, but must keep reading and find 
out how many words in a row make sense. It should return:

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>&nbsp; if the text didn't make any sense at all,</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>k</i></td><td>&nbsp; if <i>k</i> words in a row of the text seem to refer to the 
object, or</td></tr>
<tr><td>&#8722;1</td><td>&nbsp; to tell the parser it doesn't want to decide 
after all.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">The word marker <code>wn</code> can be left anywhere 
afterwards. For example, here is the fried tomato with which this section 
started:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
parse_name [ n colour;
    if (self.ripe) colour = 'red'; else colour = 'green';
    while (NextWord() == 'tomato' or 'fried' or colour) n++;
    return n;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">The effect of this is that if <code>tomato.ripe</code> is 
true then the tomato responds to the names &#8220;tomato&#8221;, &#8220;fried&#8221; 
and &#8220;red&#8221;, and otherwise to &#8220;tomato&#8221;, &#8220;fried&#8221;
and &#8220;green&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">As a second example of how <code>parse_name</code> can 
be useful, suppose you define:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; &quot;fly in amber&quot;
  with name 'fly' 'in' 'amber';
</pre>

<p class="normal">If the player then types &#8220;put fly in amber in 
hole&#8221;, the parser will be thrown, because it will think &#8220;fly 
in amber in&#8221; is all just naming the object and then it won't 
know what the word &#8220;hole&#8221; is doing at the end. However:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; &quot;fly in amber&quot;
  with parse_name [;
           if (NextWord() ~= 'fly' or 'amber') return 0;
           if (NextWord() == 'in' &amp;&amp; NextWord() == 'amber')
               return 3;
           return 1;
       ];
</pre>

<a id="p220" name="p220"></a>
<p class="normal">Now the word &#8220;in&#8221; is only recognised as 
part of the fly's name if it is followed by the word &#8220;amber&#8221;, 
and the ambiguity goes away. (&#8220;amber in amber&#8221; is also 
recognised, but then it's not worth the bother of excluding.)</p>

Straightforward <code>parse_name</code> examples are the chess pieces 
object and the kittens class of &#8216;Alice Through the Looking-Glass&#8217;. 
Lengthier ones are found in &#8216;Balances&#8217;, especially 
in the white cubes class. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Miron Schmidt's library 
extension <tt>&quot;calyx_adjectives.h&quot;</tt>, based on earlier 
work by Andrew Clover, provides for objects to have &#8220;adnames&#8221; 
as well as &#8220;names&#8221;: &#8220;adnames&#8221; are usually 
adjectives, and are regarded as being less good

<h2>&#167;37 &nbsp; Names and messages in non-English languages</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-279_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
The fourth and final part of the language definition file is taken 
up with rules on printing out messages and object names in the new 
language. The <em>gender-number-animation (GNA)</em> combination is 
considerably more important when printing nouns than when parsing them, 
because the player is less forgiving of errors. Few errors are as 
conspicuous or as painful as &#8220;You can see a gloves here.&#8221;, 
in which the library's list-writer has evidently used the wrong GNA 
for the gloves. Here is a more substantial example:</p>

<p class="output"><em>Voli&egrave;re</em><br>
Une jungle superbe, avec des animaux et des arbres.<br>
On peut voir ici trois oiseaux (une oie, un moineau et un cygne 
blanc), cinq bo&icirc;tes, une hu&icirc;tre, Edith Piaf et des raisins.</p>

<p class="normal">To print this, the list-writer needs to know that 
&#8220;oie&#8221; is feminine singular, &#8220;cygne blanc&#8221; 
is masculine singular and so on. In short, it must be told the GNA 
of every object name it ever prints, or it will append all the wrong 
articles.</p>

<p class="indent">The translator will need first to decide how the 
genders are to be used. Inform allows for three genders, called <code>male</code>, 
<code>female</code> and <code>neuter</code> because they are usually used for 
masculine, feminine and neuter genders. Different natural languages 
will use these differently. In English, all nouns are neuter except 
for those of people (and sometimes higher animals), when they follow 
the gender of the person. Latin, German and Dutch use all three genders 
without any very logical pattern, while French, Spanish and Italian
have no neuter. In Norwegian even the number of genders is a matter 
of dialect: traditional Norwegian has two genders, &#8220;common&#8221; 
and &#8220;neuter&#8221;, but more recently Norwegian has absorbed 
a new feminine gender from its rural dialects. One way to achieve 
this in Inform would be to use <code>male</code> for common, 
<code>female</code> for the rural feminine and <code>neuter</code> for 
neuter. To avoid confusion it might be worth making the definition</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Attribute common alias male;</pre>

<p class="normal">which makes <code>common</code> equivalent to writing 
<code>male</code>. (The keyword <code>alias</code> is used, though
very seldom, for making alternative names for attributes and properties.)</p>

<p class="indent">Here's how the library determines the GNA of an 
object's short name. The A part is easy: all objects having the 
<code>animate</code> attribute are animate and all others are inanimate.
Similarly for the N part: objects having <code>pluralname</code> are 
plural, all others singular. (An object having pluralname is nevertheless 
only one object: for example an object called &#8220;doors&#8221; 
which represents a pair of doubled doors, or &#8220;grapes&#8221; 
representing a bunch of grapes.) If the object has <code>male</code>, 
<code>female</code> or <code>neuter</code> then the short name has 
masculine, feminine or neuter gender accordingly. If it has none of 
these, then it defaults to the gender <code>LanguageAnimateGender</code> 
if animate and <code>LanguageInanimateGender</code> otherwise.
(These are constants set by the language definition file: see (IV.1) 
below.) You can 
<a id="p280" name="p280"></a>
find the GNA associated with an object's short name 
by calling the library routine</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">GetGNAOfObject(obj);</pre>

<p class="normal">which returns the GNA number, 0 to 11.</p>

<a id="ex114" name="ex114"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans114">EXERCISE 114</a></b></span><br>
Devise a verb so that typing &#8220;gna frog&#8221; results in &#8220;frog: 
animate singular neuter (GNA 2) / The frog / the frog / a frog&#8221;, 
thus testing all possible articled and unarticled forms of the short name.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In some languages, though not English, short names 
are inflected to make them agree with the kind of article applied to 
them:</p>

<p class="syntax">das rote Buch &nbsp; <i>the red book</i> (German)<br>
ein rotes Buch &nbsp; <i>a red book</i></p>

<p class="normal">In printing as in parsing, the library variable 
<code>indef_mode</code> holds <code>true</code> if an indefinite
article attaches to the noun phrase and <code>false</code> otherwise. 
So one rather clumsy solution would be:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object Buch
  with ...
       short_name [;
           if (indef_mode) print &quot;rotes Buch&quot;; else print &quot;rote Buch&quot;;
           rtrue;
       ];
</pre>

<p class="normal">In fact, though, the library automatically looks 
for a <code>short_name_indef</code> property when printing short 
names in indefinite cases, and uses this instead of <code>short_name</code>. 
So:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object Buch
  with short_name &quot;rote Buch&quot;, short_name_indef &quot;rotes Buch&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">An automatic system for regular inflections of short 
names is possible but not easy to get right.</p>

<p class="indent">In languages other than English, short names also 
inflect with case, and the best way to handle this may be to provide 
new printing rules like <code>dative_the</code>, enabling 
the designer to write code like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">&quot;You give &quot;, (the) noun, &quot; to &quot;, (dative_the) second, &quot;.&quot;;</pre>

<a id="p281" name="p281"></a>
<h3>(IV.1) Default genders and contraction forms</h3>

<p class="normal">Part IV of a language definition file opens with 
declarations of the default gender constants mentioned above. 
<tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> has</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant LanguageAnimateGender   = male;
Constant LanguageInanimateGender = neuter;
</pre>

<p class="normal">whereas French would define both to be <code>male</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">Inform uses the term <em>contraction form</em> 
to mean a textual feature of a noun which causes any article in front 
of it to inflect. English has two contraction forms, &#8220;starting
with a vowel&#8221; and &#8220;starting with a consonant&#8221;, 
affecting the indefinite article:</p>

<p class="syntax">a + orange = an orange<br>a + banana = a banana</p>

<p class="normal">The first constant to define is the number of 
contraction forms in the language. In the case of <tt>&quot;French.h&quot;</tt> 
there will be two:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant LanguageContractionForms = 2;</pre>

<p class="normal">Of these, form 0 means &#8220;starting with a 
consonant&#8221; and 1 means &#8220;starting with a vowel or mute h&#8221;. 
(It's up to you how you number these.) You also have to provide the
routine that decides which contraction form a piece of text has. Here 
is an abbreviated version for French, abbreviated in that it omits 
to check accented vowels like &#8216;&eacute;&#8217;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ LanguageContraction text;
  if (text-&gt;0 == 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' or 'h' or
                    'A' or 'E' or 'I' or 'O' or 'U' or 'H') return 1;
  return 0;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">The text array holds the full text of the noun, 
though this routine would normally only look at the first few letters 
at most. The routine is only ever called when it is necessary to do so: 
for instance, when the library prints &#8220;the eagles&#8221;, 
<code>LanguageContraction</code> is not called because the article 
would be the same regardless of whether &#8220;eagles&#8221; has
contraction form 0 or 1.</p>

<a id="ex115" name="ex115"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans115">EXERCISE 115</a></b></span><br>
Italian has three contraction forms: starting with a vowel, starting 
with a &#8216;z&#8217; or else &#8216;s&#8217;-followed-by-a-consonant, 
and starting with a consonant. Write a suitable 
<code>LanguageContraction</code> routine.</p>

<a id="p282" name="p282"></a>
<h3>(IV.2) How to print: articles</h3>

<p class="normal">English needs two sets of articles: one set for 
singular nouns, which we shall call article set 0, another for plurals, 
article set 1. We need to define an array to show which GNAs result 
in which article set:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
                   !             a           i
                   !             s     p     s     p
                   !             m f n m f n m f n m f n
Array LanguageGNAsToArticles --&gt; 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(The number of article sets is not defined as a 
constant, but instead by the contents of this array: here the only values 
are 0 and 1, so there need to be two article sets.) We also need to 
define the article sets themselves. There are three articles for each
combination of contraction form and article set. For example, 
<tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> has two contraction forms and two 
article sets, so we supply twelve articles:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Array LanguageArticles --&gt;
  !   Contraction form 0:     Contraction form 1:
  !   Cdef   Def    Indef     Cdef   Def    Indef
      &quot;The &quot; &quot;the &quot; &quot;a &quot;      &quot;The &quot; &quot;the &quot; &quot;an &quot;     ! Set 0
      &quot;The &quot; &quot;the &quot; &quot;some &quot;   &quot;The &quot; &quot;the &quot; &quot;some &quot;;  ! Set 1
</pre>

<p class="normal">That defines the automatic rules used to apply articles 
to nouns, but there are two ways to override this: the property <code>article</code>, 
if present, specifies an explicit indefinite article for an object; and 
the property <code>articles</code>, if present, specifies an explicit 
set of three articles. This is useful for nouns whose articles are irregular, 
such as the French &#8220;haricot&#8221;: the regular definite article 
would be &#8220;l'haricot&#8221;, but by an accident of history &#8220;le 
haricot&#8221; is correct, so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object &quot;haricot&quot;
  with articles &quot;Le &quot; &quot;le &quot; &quot;un &quot;, ...
</pre>

<a id="ex116" name="ex116"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans116">EXERCISE 116</a></b></span><br>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans117">EXERCISE 117</a></b></span><br>
Likewise for Italian, where Inform needs to be able to print a wider 
selection: un, un', una, uno, i, il, gli, l', la, le, lo.</p>

<a id="ex118" name="ex118"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans118">EXERCISE 118</a></b></span><br>
At the other extreme, what if (like Latin: &#8220;vir&#8221; <i>man</i> 
or <i>a man</i> or <i>the man</i>) a language has no articles?</p>

<a id="p283" name="p283"></a>
<h3>(IV.3) How to print: direction names</h3>

<p class="normal">Next is a routine called <code>LanguageDirection</code> 
to print names for direction properties (<em>not</em> direction objects). 
Imitate the following, from <tt>&quot;French.h&quot;</tt>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ LanguageDirection d;
  switch (d) {
      n_to:    print &quot;nord&quot;;     s_to:    print &quot;sud&quot;;
      e_to:    print &quot;est&quot;;      w_to:    print &quot;ouest&quot;;
      ne_to:   print &quot;nordest&quot;;  nw_to:   print &quot;nordouest&quot;;
      se_to:   print &quot;sudest&quot;;   sw_to:   print &quot;sudouest&quot;;
      u_to:    print &quot;haut&quot;;     d_to:    print &quot;bas&quot;;
      in_to:   print &quot;dans&quot;;     out_to:  print &quot;dehors&quot;;
      default: RunTimeError(9,d);
  }
];
</pre>

<h3>(IV.4) How to print: numbers</h3>

<p class="normal">Next is a routine called <code>LanguageNumber</code> 
which takes a number <code>N</code> and prints it out in textual form. 
<code>N</code> can be anything from <code>-32767</code> to <code>32767</code> 
and the correct text should be printed in every case. In most languages 
a recursive approach makes this routine less enormous than it might sound.</p>

<a id="ex119" name="ex119"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans119">EXERCISE 119</a></b></span><br>
Write <code>LanguageNumber</code> for French.</p>

<h3>(IV.5) How to print: the time of day</h3>

<p class="normal">Even mostly numeric representations of the time 
of day vary from language to language: when it's 1:23 pm in England, 
it's 13h23 in France. A routine called <code>LanguageTimeOfDay</code> 
should print out the language's preferred form of the time of day, 
like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ LanguageTimeOfDay hours mins;
  print hours/10, hours%10, &quot;h&quot;, mins/10, mins%10;
];
</pre>

<a id="ex120" name="ex120"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans120">EXERCISE 120</a></b></span><br>
Write the corresponding English version.</p>

<h3>(IV.6) How to print: verbs</h3>

<p class="normal">The parser sometimes needs to print verbs out, in 
messages like:</p>

<p class="output">I only understood you as far as wanting to
<em>take</em> the red box.</p>

<p class="normal">It normally does this by simply printing out the 
verb's dictionary entry. However, dictionary entries tend to be cut 
short (to the first 9 letters or so) or else to be 
<a id="p284" name="p284"></a>
abbreviations (rather 
as &#8220;i&#8221; means &#8220;inventory&#8221;). In your language, verbs 
might also need to inflect in a sentence like the one above, which assumes 
that the infinitive and imperative are the same. You might get around 
that by rewording the statement as:</p>

<p class="output">I only understood you as far as &#8220;<em>take</em> the 
red box&#8221;.</p>

<p class="normal">Even so, how to print out verbs depends on the language, 
so you need to give a routine called <code>LanguageVerb</code> which 
looks at its argument and either prints a textual form and returns 
true, or returns false to let the library carry on as normal. In English, 
only a few of the more commonly-used abbreviations are glossed, and 
&#8220;x&#8221; for &#8220;examine&#8221; is the only one that really matters:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ LanguageVerb verb_word;
  switch (verb_word) {
      'l//': print &quot;look&quot;;
      'z//': print &quot;wait&quot;;
      'x//': print &quot;examine&quot;;
      'i//', 'inv', 'inventory': print &quot;inventory&quot;;
      default: rfalse;
  }
  rtrue;
];
</pre>

<h3>(IV.7) How to print: menus</h3>

<p class="normal">Next, a batch of definitions should be made to specify 
the look of menus and which keys on the keyboard navigate through them. 
Imitate the following <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> definitions, if 
possible keeping the strings the same length (padding out with spaces 
if your translations are shorter than the English original):</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant NKEY__TX     = &quot;N = next subject&quot;;
Constant PKEY__TX     = &quot;P = previous&quot;;
Constant QKEY1__TX    = &quot;  Q = resume game&quot;;
Constant QKEY2__TX    = &quot;Q = previous menu&quot;;<a id="p285" name="p285"></a>
Constant RKEY__TX     = &quot;RETURN = read subject&quot;;
Constant NKEY1__KY    = 'N';
Constant NKEY2__KY    = 'n';
Constant PKEY1__KY    = 'P';
Constant PKEY2__KY    = 'p';
Constant QKEY1__KY    = 'Q';
Constant QKEY2__KY    = 'q';
</pre>

<h3>(IV.8) How to print: miscellaneous short messages</h3>

<p class="normal">These are phrases or words so short that the author 
decided they probably weren't worth putting in the <code>LibraryMessages</code>
system (he now thinks otherwise: code in haste, repent at leisure). Here 
are some French versions with notes.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant SCORE__TX    = &quot;Score: &quot;;
Constant MOVES__TX    = &quot;Tours: &quot;;
Constant TIME__TX     = &quot;Heure: &quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">which define the text printed on the status line: 
in English, &#8220;Score&#8221; and &#8220;Turns&#8221; or &#8220;Time&#8221;;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant CANTGO__TX   = &quot;On ne peut pas aller en ce direction.&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">the default &#8220;You can't go that way&#8221; message;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant FORMER__TX   = &quot;votre m@^eme ancien&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">the short name of the player's former self, after the 
player has become somebody else by use of the <code>ChangePlayer</code> 
routine;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant YOURSELF__TX = &quot;votre m@^eme&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">the short name of the player object;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant DARKNESS__TX = &quot;Obscurit@'e&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">the short name of a location in darkness;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant NOTHING__TX  = &quot;rien&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">the short name of the <code>nothing</code> object, 
caused by <code>print (name) 0;</code>, which is not strictly speaking 
legal anyway;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant THAT__TX     = &quot;@cca&quot;;
Constant THOSET__TX   = &quot;ces choses&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(<code>THOSET</code> stands for &#8220;those things&#8221;) 
used in command printing. There are three circumstances in which all or 
part of a command can be printed by the parser: for an incomplete command, 
a vague command or an overlong one. Thus</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>take out</tt><br>
What do you want to take out?<br>
&gt;<tt>give frog</tt><br>
(to Professor Moriarty)<br><a id="p286" name="p286"></a>
&gt;<tt>take frog within cage</tt><br>
I only understood you as far as wanting to take the frog.</p>

<p class="normal">In such messages, the <code>THOSET__TX</code> text 
is printed in place of a multiple object like &#8220;all&#8221; while 
<code>THAT__TX</code> is printed in place of a number or of something 
not well understood by the parser, like the result of a <code>topic</code> 
token.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant OR__TX      = &quot; ou &quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">appears in the list of objects being printed in a 
question asking you which thing you mean: if you can't find anything 
grammatical to go here, try using just <tt>&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;;</tt></p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant AND__TX     = &quot; et &quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">used to divide up many kinds of list;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant WHOM__TX     = &quot;qui &quot;;
Constant WHICH__TX    = &quot;lequel &quot;;
Constant IS2__TX      = &quot;est &quot;;
Constant ARE2__TX     = &quot;sont &quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">used only to print text like &#8220;inside which is 
a duck&#8221;, &#8220;on top of whom are two drakes&#8221;;</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant IS__TX       = &quot; est&quot;;
Constant ARE__TX      = &quot; sont&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">used only by the list-maker and only when the 
<code>ISARE_BIT</code> is set; the library only does this from 
within <code>LibraryMessages</code>, so you can avoid the need altogether.</p>

<h3>(IV.9) How to print: the Library Messages</h3>

<p class="normal">Finally, Part IV contains an extensive block of translated 
library messages, making up at least half the bulk of the language definition 
file. Here is the entry for a typical verb in <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
SwitchOn:
    switch (n) {
        1: print_ret (ctheyreorthats) x1,
               &quot; not something you can switch.&quot;;
        2: print_ret (ctheyreorthats) x1,
               &quot; already on.&quot;;
        3: &quot;You switch &quot;, (the) x1, &quot; on.&quot;;
    }
</pre>

<a id="p287" name="p287"></a>
<p class="normal">You have to translate every one of these messages 
to at least a near equivalent. It may be useful to define new printing 
rules, just as <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> does:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ CTheyreorThats obj;
  if (obj == player) { print &quot;You're&quot;; return; }
  if (obj has pluralname) { print &quot;They're&quot;; return; }
  if (obj has animate)
  {   if (obj has female) { print &quot;She's&quot;; return; }
      else if (obj hasnt neuter) { print &quot;He's&quot;; return; }
  }
  print &quot;That's&quot;;

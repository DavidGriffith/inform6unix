<h2>&#167;20 &nbsp; Daemons and the passing of time</h2>

<blockquote>Some, such as Sleep and Love, were never human. 
From this class an individual daemon is allotted to each human being 
as his &#8216;witness and guardian&#8217; through life.<br>
&#8212; C. S. Lewis (1898&#8211;1963), <i>The Discarded Image</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>A great Daemon&#8230; Through him subsist all divination, 
and the science of sacred things as it relates to sacrifices, and 
expiations, and disenchantments, and prophecy, and magic&#8230; he 
who is wise in the science of this intercourse is supremely happy&#8230;<br>
&#8212; Plato (c.427&#8211;347 B.C.), <i>The Symposium</i>, in 
the translation by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792&#8211;1822)</blockquote>

To medieval philosophers, daemons were the intermediaries of God, 
hovering invisibly over the world and interfering with it. They may 
be guardian spirits of places or people. So also with Inform:
a daemon is a meddling spirit, associated with a particular game
object, which gets a chance to interfere once per turn while it is 
&#8216;active&#8217;. &#8216;Advent&#8217; has five: one to deplete 
the lamp's batteries, three to move the bear, the pirate and the 
threatening little dwarves and one to close the cave when all the 
treasures have been collected. Though there isn't much to say about
daemons, they are immensely useful, and there are some rule-based 
design systems for interactive fiction in which the daemon is a more 
fundamental concept than the object. (The early 1980s system by Scott 
Adams, for instance.)</p>

<p class="indent">The daemon attached to an object is its <code>daemon</code> 
routine, if one is given. However, a daemon is normally inactive, and 
must be explicitly activated and deactivated using the library 
routines</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
StartDaemon(object);
StopDaemon(object);
</pre>

<p class="normal">Daemons are often started by a game's <code>Initialise</code> 
routine and sometimes remain active throughout. When active, the <code>daemon</code> 
property of the object is called at the end of each turn, regardless 
of where that object is or what the circumstances, provided only that 
the player is still alive. This makes daemons useful for &#8216;tidying-up 
operations&#8217;, putting rooms back in order after the player has moved 
on, or for the consequences of actions to catch up with the player.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans42">EXERCISE 42</a></b></span><br>
Many games contain &#8220;wandering monsters&#8221;, characters who 
walk around the map. Use a daemon to implement one who wanders as freely 
as the player, like the gentleman thief in &#8216;Zork&#8217;.</p>

<a id="ex43" name="ex43"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans43">EXERCISE 43</a></b></span><br>
Use a background daemon to implement a system of weights, so that the 
player can only carry a certain weight before strength gives out and 
something must be dropped. It should allow for feathers to be lighter 
than lawn-mowers.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">It's also possible to attach a timer to an object. 
(In other design languages, timers are called &#8220;fuses&#8221;.) 
To set up a timer, you need to give an object two properties: 
<code>time_left</code> and <code>time_out</code>. Like daemons, timers 
are inactive until explicitly started:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">StartTimer(object, time);</pre>

<p class="normal">will set <code>object.time_left</code> to <code>time</code>. 
This value will be reduced by 1 each turn, except that if this would make 
it negative, the Inform library instead sends the message</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">object.time_out()</pre>

<p class="normal">once and once only, after which the timer is deactivated 
again. You're free to alter <code>time_left</code> yourself: a value 
of 0 means &#8220;will go off at the end of the present turn&#8221;, 
so setting <code>time_left</code> to 0 triggers immediate activation. 
You can also deactivate the timer, so that it never goes off, by calling</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">StopTimer(object);</pre>

<a id="ex44" name="ex44"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans44">EXERCISE 44</a></b></span><br>
Construct an egg-timer which runs for three turns.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
At most 32 timers or daemons can be active at the same time, together 
with any number of inactive ones. This limit of 32 is easily raised, 
though: just define the constant <code>MAX_TIMERS</code> to some larger 
value, putting the definition in your code before <tt>&quot;Parser.h&quot;</tt> 
is included.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p159" name="p159"></a>
<p class="normal">There is yet a third form of timed event. If a 
room provides an <code>each_turn</code> routine, then the library 
will send the message</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">location.each_turn()</pre>

<p class="normal">at the end of every turn when the player is present. 
Similarly, for every object <code>O</code> which is near the player 
and provides <code>each_turn</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">O.each_turn()</pre>

<p class="normal">will be sent every turn. This would be one way to 
code the sword of &#8216;Zork&#8217;, for instance, which begins to 
glow when monsters are nearby. <code>each_turn</code> is also convenient 
to run creatures which stay in one place and are only active when the 
player is nearby. An ogre with limited patience can therefore have an 
<code>each_turn</code> routine which worries the player (&#8220;The 
ogre stamps his feet angrily!&#8221; and so forth) while also having 
a timer set to go off when patience runs out.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
&#8220;Near the player&#8221; actually means &#8220;in scope&#8221;, 
a term which will be properly defined in <a href="s32.html">&#167;32</a> 
but which roughly translates as &#8220;in the same place and visible&#8221;. 
You can change the scope rules using an <code>InScope</code> routine, 
say to make the &#8216;Zork I&#8217; thief audible throughout the 
maze he is wandering around in. In case you want to tell whether scope
is being worked out for ordinary parsing reasons or instead for <code>each_turn</code> 
processing, look to see whether the <code>scope_reason</code> variable 
has the value <code>EACHTURN_REASON</code>. (Again, see 
<a href="s32.html">&#167;32</a> for more.)</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
It is safe to move an object when its own <code>each_turn</code> rule 
is running, but not to move any other objects which are likely to be 
in scope.</p>

<a id="ex45" name="ex45"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans45">EXERCISE 45</a></b></span><br>
(&#8216;Ruins&#8217;.) Make &#8220;the sound of scuttling claws&#8221; 
approach in darkness and, after 4 consecutive turns in darkness, kill 
the player.</p>

<a id="ex46" name="ex46"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans46">EXERCISE 46</a></b></span><br>
Now try implementing the scuttling claws in a single object definition, 
with no associated code anywhere else in the program, not even a line 
in <code>Initialise</code>, and without running its <code>daemon</code> 
all the time.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The library also has a limited ability to keep track 
of time of day as the game goes on. The current time is held in the 
variable <code>the_time</code> and runs on a 24-hour clock: this variable 
holds the number of minutes since midnight, so it takes values between 
0 and 1439. The time can be set by</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>SetTime(</code>60 &#215; &#8249;<span
 class="token">hours</span>&#8250; + &#8249;<span class="token">minutes</span>&#8250;,
 &#8249;<span class="token">rate</span>&#8250; <code>);</code></p>

<a id="p160" name="p160"></a>
<p class="normal">The <code>rate</code> controls how rapidly time 
is moving: a <code>rate</code> of 0 means it is standing still, that 
is, that the library doesn't change it: your routines still can. 
A positive <code>rate</code> means that that many minutes pass between 
each turn, while a negative rate means that many turns pass between 
each minute. It's usual for a timed game to start off the clock by 
calling <code>SetTime</code> in its <code>Initialise</code> routine. 
The time will appear on the game's status line, replacing the usual 
listing of score and turns, if you set</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Statusline time;</pre>

<p class="normal">as a directive at the start of your source code.</p>

<li>(4) <code>each_turn</code> takes place for the current room, 
and then for every object in scope.</li>
<li>(5) An entry point called <code>TimePasses</code> is called, 
if the game provides such a routine.</li>
<li>(6) Light is re-considered (see <a href="s19.html">&#167;19</a>).</li>
<li>(7) Any items the player now holds which have not previously been 
held are given the <code>moved</code> attribute, and score is awarded 
if appropriate (see <a href="s22.html">&#167;22</a>).</li>

Suppose the player is magically suspended in mid-air, but that anything 
let go of will fall out of sight. The natural way to code this is to 
use a daemon which gets rid of anything it finds on the floor: this 
is better than trapping <code>Drop</code> actions because objects
might end up on the floor in many different ways. Why is <code>each_turn</code> 
better still?</p>

Daemons abound in most games. Apart from &#8216;Advent&#8217;, see 
the flying tortoise from &#8216;Balances&#8217; and the chiggers from 
&#8216;Adventureland&#8217;. For more ingenious uses of <code>daemon</code>,
see the helium balloon and the matchbook from &#8216;Toyshop&#8217;. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Typical timers include the 
burning match and the hand grenade from &#8216;Toyshop&#8217;, the 
endgame timer from &#8216;Advent&#8217; and the &#8216;Balances&#8217; 
cyclops (also employing <code>each_turn</code>). &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>&#8216;Adventureland&#8217;
makes much use of <code>each_turn</code>: see the golden fish, the mud, 
the dragon and the bees. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>The chapter of &#8216;Jigsaw&#8217; 
set on the Moon runs the clock at rate &#8722;28, to allow for 
the length of the lunar day. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>The library extension 
<tt>&quot;timewait.h&quot;</tt> by Andrew Clover thoroughly implements 
time of day, allowing the player to &#8220;wait until quarter past 
three&#8221;. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Whereas Erik Hetzner's 
<tt>&quot;printtime.h&quot;</tt> does just the reverse: it prints out 
Inform's numerical values of time in the form of text like &#8220;half 
past seven&#8221;. Erik is also author of <tt>&quot;timepiece.h&quot;</tt>, 
which models watches and clocks, allowing them to run slow or fast 
compared to the library's absolute notion of time. (As yet nobody has
needed a relativistic world model.)</p>

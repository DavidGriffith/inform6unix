<P>

Suppose Dan's grammar (but nobody else's) for the "examine''
verb is to be extended.  His grammar routine should also contain:
<PRE>
           if (verb_word == 'examine' or 'x')
           {   verb_wordnum++; return -'danx,'; }
</PRE>

(Note the crudity of this: it looks at the actual verb word, so you
have to check any synonyms yourself.)  The verb "danx,'' must be
declared later:
<PRE>
Verb "danx," * "conscience" -&#62; Inv;
</PRE>

and now "Dan, examine conscience'' will send him an <TT>Inv</TT> order:
but "Dan, examine cow pie'' will still send <TT>Examine cow_pie</TT> as usual.

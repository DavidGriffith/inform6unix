<h2>&#167;39 &nbsp; Controlling compilation from without</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-295_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
The Inform compiler has the equivalent of a dashboard of &#8220;command 
line switches&#8221;, controlling its behaviour. Most of these have only 
two settings, off or on, and most of them are off most of the time. 
Others can be set to a number between 0 and 9. In this book switches are 
written preceded by a minus sign, just as they would be typed if you 
were using Inform from the command line of (say) Unix or RISC OS. 
Setting <tt>-x</tt>, for instance, causes Inform to print a row of 
hash signs as it compiles:</p>

<p class="output"><tt>inform -x shell<br>
RISC OS Inform 6.20 (10th December 1998)<br>
::##############################################################<br>
#################</tt></p>

<p class="normal">One hash sign is printed for every 100 textual lines 
of source code compiled, so this row represents about eight thousand lines. 
(During the above compilation, carried out by an Acorn Risc PC 700, hashes 
were printed at a rate of about thirty per second.) <tt>-x</tt> is 
provided not so much for information as to indicate that a slow compilation 
is continuing normally. Contrariwise, the <tt>-s</tt> switch offers 
more statistics than you could possibly have wanted, as in the following
monster compilation (of &#8216;Curses&#8217;):</p>

<a id="p296" name="p296"></a>
<p class="normal">The complete list of switches is listed when you 
run Inform with <tt>-h2</tt>, and also in <a href="tables.html#tbl3">Table 3</a> 
at the back of this book, where there are notes on some of the odder-looking 
ones.</p>

<p class="indent">When the statistics listing claims that, for instance, 
the maximum space for arrays is 10,000, this is so because Inform has 
only allocated enough memory to keep track of 10,000 entries while 
compiling. This in turn is because Inform's &#8220;memory setting&#8221; 
<code>$MAX_STATIC_DATA</code> was set to 10,000 when the compilation 
took place.</p>

<p class="indent">Between them, the &#8220;memory settings&#8221; control 
how much of your computer's memory Inform uses while running. Too little 
and it may not be able to compile games of the size you need, but too 
much and it may choke any other programs in the computer for space. 
It's left up to you to adjust the memory settings to suit your own 
environment, but most people leave them alone until an error message 
advises a specific increase.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, Inform has &#8220;path variables&#8221;, 
which contain filenames for the files Inform uses or creates. Usage 
of these varies widely from one operating system to another. 
Run Inform with the <tt>-h1</tt> switch for further information.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Inform's switches, path variables and memory settings 
are set using &#8220;Inform Command Language&#8221; or ICL. The usual 
way to issue ICL commands, at least on installations of Inform which 
don't have windowed front-ends, is to squeeze them onto the command 
line. The standard command line syntax is</p>

<p class="syntax"><tt>inform</tt> 
&#8249;<span class="token">ICL commands</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">source file</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">output file</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">where only the &#8249;<span class="token">source file</span>&#8250;
is mandatory. By default, the full names to give the source and output 
files are derived in a way suitable for the machine Inform is running 
on: on a PC, for instance, <tt>advent</tt> may be understood as asking
to compile <tt>advent.inf</tt> to <tt>advent.z5</tt>. This is called 
&#8220;filename translation&#8221;. No detailed information on filenaming 
rules is given here, because it varies so much from machine to machine: 
see the <tt>-h1</tt> on-line documentation. Note that a filename can 
contain spaces if it is written in double-quotes and if the operating 
system being used can cope with spaces (as Mac OS can, for instance).</p>

<p class="indent">To specify sprawling or peculiar projects may need 
more ICL commands than can fit comfortably onto the command line. 
One possible ICL command, however, is to give a filename in (round) 
brackets: e.g.,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform -x (skyfall_setup) ...</pre>

<a id="p297" name="p297"></a>
<p class="normal">which sets the <tt>-x</tt> switch, then runs through 
the text file <tt>skyfall_setup</tt> executing each line as an ICL 
command. This file then look like this:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
! Setup file for &quot;Skyfall&quot;
-d                   ! Contract double spaces
$max_objects=1000    ! 500 of them snowflakes
(usual_setup)        ! include my favourite settings, too
+module_path=mods    ! keep modules in the &quot;mods&quot; directory
</pre>

<p class="normal">ICL can include comments if placed after <code>!</code>, 
just as in Inform. Otherwise, an ICL file has only one command per line, 
with no dividing semicolons. Using ICL allows you to compile whole 
batches of files as required, altering switches, path variables 
and memory settings as you go. Notice that ICL files can call up other 
ICL files, as in the example above: don't allow a file to call up another
copy of itself, or the compilation will all end in tears.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
When typing such a command into a shell under a Unix-like operating systems,
you may need to quote the parentheses:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform -x '(skyfall_setup)' ...</pre>

<p class="aside">This instructs the shell to pass on the command literally 
to Inform, and not to react to unusual characters like <code>$</code>, 
<code>?</code>, <code>(</code> or <code>)</code> in it. The same may 
be needed for other ICL commands such as:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform -x '$MAX_OBJECTS=2000' ...</pre>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Windowed front-ends for Inform sometimes work by letting the user select 
various options and then, when the &#8220;Go&#8221; button is pressed, 
convert the state of the dialogue box into an ICL file which is passed 
to Inform.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
If you need to use Inform without benefit of either a command line or 
a fancy front-end, or if you want your source code to specify its own 
switch settings, you can still set (most) switches by placing the directive</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>Switches</code> &#8249;<span class="token">some 
settings</span>&#8250;<code>;</code></p>

<p class="aside">at the very beginning of your source code. (So that 
you can still override such settings, the switch <tt>-i</tt> tells 
Inform to ignore all <code>Switches</code> directives.)</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p298" name="p298"></a>
<p class="normal">The ICL commands are as follows:</p>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>-</code>&#8249;<span class="token">switches</span>&#8250;<br>
Set these switches; or unset any switch preceded by a tilde <code>~</code>. 
(For example, <code>-a~bc</code> sets <code>a</code>, unsets <code>b</code> 
and sets <code>c</code>.)</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>$list</code><br>
List current memory settings.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>$?</code>&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<br>
Ask for information on what this memory setting is for.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>$small</code><br>
Set the whole collection of memory settings to suitable levels for a 
small game.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>$large</code><br>
Ditto, for a slightly larger game.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>$huge</code><br>
Ditto, for a reasonably big one.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>$</code>&#8249;<span 
class="token">name</span>&#8250;<code>=</code>&#8249;<span 
class="token">quantity</span>&#8250;<br>
Alter the named memory setting to the given level.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>+</code>&#8249;<span 
class="token">name</span>&#8250;<code>=</code>&#8249;<span 
class="token">filename</span>&#8250;<br>
Set the named pathname variable to the given filename, which should be 
one or more filenames of directories, separated by commas.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>compile</code> &#8249;<span 
class="token">filename</span>&#8250; &#8249;<span
class="token">filename</span>&#8250;<br>
Compile the first-named file, containing source code, writing the 
output program to the (optional) second-named file.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><code>(</code>&#8249;<span 
class="token">filename</span>&#8250;<code>)</code><br>
Execute this ICL file (files may call each other in this way).</p></div>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">It's a nuisance to have to move all the memory settings 
up or down to cope with a big game or a small computer, so <code>$small</code>, 
<code>$large</code> and <code>$huge</code> are provided as short cuts. 
Typically these might allocate 350K, 500K or 610K respectively.
Running</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform $list</pre>

<p class="normal">will list the various settings which can be changed, 
and their current values. Thus one can compare small and large with:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
inform $small $list
inform $large $list
</pre>

<a id="p299" name="p299"></a>
<p class="normal">If Inform runs out of allocation for something, it 
will generally print an error message like:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
&quot;Game&quot;, line 1320: Fatal error: The memory setting MAX_OBJECTS
(which is 200 at present) has been exceeded.  Try running Inform
again with $MAX_OBJECTS=&lt;some-larger-number&gt; on the command line.
</pre>

<p class="normal">and it would then be sensible to try</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform $MAX_OBJECTS=250 game</pre>

<p class="normal">which tells Inform to try again, reserving more memory 
for objects this time. ICL commands are followed from left to right, so</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform $small $MAX_ACTIONS=200 ...</pre>

<p class="normal">will work, but</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform $MAX_ACTIONS=200 $small ...</pre>

<p class="normal">will not because the <code>$small</code> changes 
<code>MAX_ACTIONS</code> back again. Changing some settings has 
hardly any effect on memory usage, whereas others are expensive to 
increase. To find out about, say, <code>MAX_VERBS</code>, run</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">inform $?MAX_VERBS</pre>

<p class="normal" style="margin-bottom:1em">(note the question mark) which will print some very 
brief comments.</p>

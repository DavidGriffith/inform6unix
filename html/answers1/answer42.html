<P>

Two reasons.  Firstly, there are times when we want to be able
to trap orders to other people, which <TT>react_before</TT> does not.
Secondly, the player's <TT>react_before</TT> rule is not necessarily
the first to react.  In the case of the player's deafness, a cuckoo
may have already used <TT>react_before</TT> to sing.  But it would have been
safe to use <TT>GamePreRoutine</TT>, if a little untidy (because a rule about
the player would not be part of the player's definition, which makes
for confusing source code).  See <A HREF="section9.html">Section 9</A> for the exact sequence of events
when actions are processed.

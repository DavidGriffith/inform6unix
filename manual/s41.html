Infocom's games of 1979&#8211;89 were written in a language called
ZIL, the Zork Implementation Language. At first sight this is outlandishly 
unlike Inform, but appearances are deceptive. The following source code 
describes toy boats in Kensington Park, from a game widely considered 
a masterpiece: &#8216;Trinity&#8217; (1986), by Brian Moriarty.</p>

<p class="normal">Inform and ZIL each have objects, with properties and 
attributes. They're called different things, true: ZIL has its dictionary 
words in <code>SYNONYM</code> and <code>ADJECTIVE</code> where Inform 
uses <code>name</code>, ZIL calls attributes &#8220;flags&#8221; and 
has NODESC where Inform would have <code>scenery</code>, but the similarity 
is striking. Both languages have routines with a tendency to return 
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, too.</p>

<p class="indent">The underlying similarity is the Z-machine, which both 
languages make use of. The Z-machine is an imaginary computer: created 
on Joel Berez's mother's coffee table in Pittsburgh in 1979, it has 
never existed as circuitry. 
<a id="p315" name="p315"></a>
Instead, almost every real computer built 
in the 1980s and 1990s has been taught to emulate the Z-machine, and 
so to run story files.</p>

<p class="indent">This chapter contains what the advanced Inform programmer 
needs, from time to time, to know about the Z-machine. The reader who 
only wants to get at fairly easy screen effects like coloured text may 
want to turn straight to the references to <a href="s42.html">&#167;42</a>, 
where a number of convenient library extensions are listed.</p>

<p class="indent">In any case this chapter is by no means the full story, 
which is contained in <i>The Z-Machine Standards Document</i>. It seems 
nonetheless appropriate to acknowledge here the work of the Z-machine's 
architects: Joel Berez, Marc Blank, P. David Lebling, Tim Anderson and 
others.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The Z-machine as conceived in 1979 is now known 
as &#8220;version 1&#8221;, and there have been seven subsequent versions 
to date. Inform normally produces version 5 story files, but this can 
be controlled with the <tt>-v</tt> switch: so <tt>-v6</tt> compiles 
a version 6 story file, for instance. Briefly, the versions are:</p>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Versions 1 and 2.</i>&nbsp;
Early draft designs by Infocom, used only in the first release of the 
&#8216;Zork&#8217; trilogy. Inform cannot produce them.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Version 3.</i>&nbsp;
The standard Infocom design, limited in various ways: to 255 objects, 
32 attributes, at most 4 entries in a property array, at most 3
arguments in a routine call and a story file at most 128K in size. 
Inform can produce version 3 files but this is not recommended and 
some advanced features of the language, such as message-sending, will 
not work.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Version 4.</i>&nbsp;
A partial upgrade, now seldom used.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Version 5.</i>&nbsp;
The advanced Infocom design and the one normally used by Inform. 
Limits are raised to 65,535 objects, 48 attributes, 32 entries in a
property array, 7 arguments in a routine call and a story file at most 
256K in size.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Version 6.</i>&nbsp;
Similar, though not identical, in architecture to Version 5, but offering 
support for pictures. Inform will compile to this, but there are two
further obstructions: you need a way to package up the sounds and images 
to go with the story file (see <a href="s43.html">&#167;43</a>), and 
then players need an interpreter able to make use of them.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Version 7.</i>&nbsp;
An intermediate version which has never proved useful, and whose use 
is now deprecated.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal"><i>Version 8.</i>&nbsp;
Identical to version 5 except that it allows story files up to 512K
long. Most of the largest Inform games use version 8.</p></div>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p316" name="p316"></a>
<p class="normal">The native language of the Z-machine is neither Inform 
nor ZIL, but an intermediate-level code which we'll call &#8220;assembly 
language&#8221;. It's tiresome to write a program of any complexity in 
assembly language. For instance, here are two equivalent pieces of 
Inform: first, a statement in ordinary code:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">&quot;The answer is &quot;, 3*subtotal + 1;</pre>

<p class="normal">Secondly, assembly language which achieves the same end:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
@print &quot;The answer is &quot;;
@mul 3 subtotal -&gt; x;
@add x 1 -&gt; x;
@print_num x;
@new_line;
@rtrue;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(Here we've used a variable called <code>x</code>.) 
Inform allows you to mix assembly language and ordinary Inform source 
code freely, but all commands in assembly language, called &#8220;opcodes&#8221;, 
are written with an <code>@</code> sign in front, to distinguish them. The values supplied 
to opcodes, such as <code>3</code> and <code>subtotal</code>, are called &#8220;operands&#8221;. 
The <code>-&gt;</code> arrow sign is read &#8220;store to&#8221; and 
indicates that an answer is being stored somewhere. So, for instance, the line</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">@add x 1 -&gt; x;</pre>

<p class="normal">adds <code>x</code> and 1, storing the result of this 
addition back in <code>x</code>. Operands can only be constants or 
variables: so you can't write a compound expression like
<code>my_array--&gt;(d*4)</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">As can be seen above, some opcodes store values and 
some don't. Another important category are the &#8220;branch&#8221; opcodes, 
which result in execution jumping to a different place in the source 
code if some condition turns out to be true, and not otherwise. For instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
@je x 1 ?Xisone;
@print &quot;x isn't equal to 1.&quot;;
.Xisone;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Here, <code>Xisone</code> is the name of a label, 
marking a point in the source code which a branch opcode (or an Inform 
<code>jump</code> statement) might want to jump to. (A label can't 
be the last thing in a function, but if you needed this, you could always 
finish with a label plus a <code>return</code> statement instead.) <code>@je</code> 
means &#8220;jump 
<a id="p317" name="p317"></a>
if equal&#8221;, so the code tests <code>x</code> to see 
if it's equal to 1 and jumps to <code>Xisone</code> if so. Inform will 
only allow branches to labels in the same routine. Note that inserting 
a tilde,</p>

<pre class="code">@je x 1 ?~Xisntone;</pre>

<p class="normal">reverses the condition, so this opcode branches if 
<code>x</code> is not equal to 1.</p>

<p class="indent">The full specification of Inform's assembly-language 
syntax is given in &#167;14 of <i>The Z-Machine Standards Document</i>, 
but this will seldom if ever be needed, because the present chapter contains 
everything that can't be done more easily without assembly language anyway.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The rest of this section sketches the architecture of the Z-machine, 
which many designers won't need to know about. Briefly, it contains memory 
in three sections: readable and writeable memory at byte addresses 0 up 
to <i>S</i>&#8722;1, read-only memory from <i>S</i> up to 
<i>P</i>&#8722;1 and inaccessible memory from <i>P</i> upwards. (In 
any story file, the Inform expression <code>0--&gt;2</code> gives the 
value of <i>P</i> and <code>0--&gt;7</code> gives <i>S</i>.) The 
read-write area contains everything that needs to change in play: 
variables, object properties and attributes, arrays and certain other 
tables; except for the stack and the &#8220;program counter&#8221;, 
its marker as to which part of some routine it is currently running. 
The beginning of the read-write area is a 64-byte &#8220;header&#8221;. 
Byte 0 of this header, and so of an entire story file, contains the 
version number of the Z-machine for which it is written. (The expression 
<code>0-&gt;0</code> evaluates to this.)</p>

<p class="aside">The read-only area contains tables which the Inform parser 
needs to make detailed use of but never alters: the grammar lines and 
the dictionary, for instance. The &#8220;inaccessible&#8221; area contains 
routines and static (that is, unalterable) strings of text. These can 
be called or printed out, which is access of a sort, but you can't write 
code which will examine them one byte at a time.</p>

<p class="aside">In addition to local and global variables, the Z-machine 
contains a &#8220;stack&#8221;, which is accessed with the name <code>sp</code> 
for &#8220;stack pointer&#8221;. The stack is a pile of values. Each
time <code>sp</code> is written to, a new value is placed on top of the 
pile. Each time it is read, the value being read is taken off the pile. 
At the start of a routine, the stack is always empty.</p>

<p class="aside">There is no access to the outside world except by 
using certain opcodes. For instance, <code>@read</code> and <code>@read_char</code> 
allow use of the keyboard, whereas <code>@print</code> and
<code>@draw_picture</code> allow use of the screen. (The screen's image 
is not stored anywhere in memory, and nor is the state of the keyboard.) 
Conversely, hardware can cause the Z-machine to &#8220;interrupt&#8221;, 
that is, to make a spontaneous call to a particular routine, interrupting 
what it was previously working on. This happens only if the story file 
has previously requested it: for example, by setting a sound effect playing 
and asking for a routine to be called when it finishes; or by asking 
for an interrupt if thirty seconds pass while the player is thinking 
what to type.</p>

<h2>&#167;29 &nbsp; Plural names for duplicated objects</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-222_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
A notorious challenge for adventure game parsers is to handle a
collection of, say, ten gold coins, allowing the player to use them
independently of each other, while gathering them together into
groups in descriptions and inventories. Two problems must be
overcome: firstly, the game has to be able to talk to the player in 
plurals, and secondly vice versa. First, then, game to player:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class GoldCoin
  with name 'gold' 'coin',
       short_name &quot;gold coin&quot;,
       plural &quot;gold coins&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(and then similar silver and bronze coin classes)</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object bag &quot;bag&quot;
  with name 'bag',
  has  container open openable;
GoldCoin -&gt;;
GoldCoin -&gt;;
GoldCoin -&gt;;
SilverCoin -&gt;;
SilverCoin -&gt;;
BronzeCoin -&gt;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Now we have a bag of six coins. The player looking 
inside the bag will get</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>look inside bag</tt><br>
In the bag are three gold coins, two silver coins and a bronze coin.</p>

<p class="normal">How does the library know that the three gold coins 
are the same as each other, but the others different? It doesn't look 
at the classes but the names. It will only group together things which:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>have a <code>plural</code> set, and</li>
<li>are &#8220;indistinguishable&#8221; from each other.</li>
</ol>

<p class="normal">&#8220;Indistinguishable&#8221; means they have the 
same name words as each other, possibly in a different order, so that 
nothing the player can type will separate the two.</p>

<a id="p223" name="p223"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Actually, it's a little more subtle than this. What it groups together 
depends slightly on the context of the list being written. When it's 
writing a list which prints out details of which objects are providing 
light, for instance (as an inventory does), it won't group together two 
objects if one is lit but the other isn't. Similarly for objects 
with visible possessions or which can be worn.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
This ramifies further when the objects have a <code>parse_name</code> routine 
supplied. If they have different <code>parse_name</code> routines, 
the library decides that they are distinguishable. But if they have 
the same <code>parse_name</code> routine, for instance by inheriting 
it from a class definition, then the library has no alternative 
but to ask them. What happens is that:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>A variable called <code>parser_action</code> is set to the special 
value <code>##TheSame</code>, a value it never has at any other time;</li>
<li>Two variables, called <code>parser_one</code> and <code>parser_two</code> 
are set to the two objects in question;</li>
<li>Their <code>parse_name</code> routine is called. If it returns:
 <div style="margin-left:30px">
 &#8722;1 &nbsp; the objects are declared &#8220;indistinguishable&quot;;<br>
 &#8722;2 &nbsp; they are declared different.
 </div></li>
<li>Otherwise, the usual rules apply and the library looks at 
the ordinary <code>name</code> fields of the objects.</li>
</ol>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
You may even want to provide a <code>parse_name</code> routine for 
objects which otherwise don't need one, just to speed up the process 
of the library telling if two objects are distinguishable &#8211; if 
there were 30 gold coins in one place the parser would be doing a
lot of work comparing names, but you can make the decision much faster.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans79">EXERCISE 79</a></b></span><br>
Perhaps the neatest trick of parsing in any Infocom game occurs in 
&#8216;Spellbreaker&#8217;, which has a set of white cubes which are 
indistinguishable until the player writes words onto them with a magic 
burin (a medieval kind of pen), after which it's possible to tell
them apart. Imitate this in Inform.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Secondly, the player talking to the computer.
Suppose a game involves collecting a number of similar items, such 
as a set of nine crowns in different colours. Then you'd want the 
parser to recognise things like:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>drop all of the crowns except green</tt><br>
&gt;<tt>drop the three other crowns</tt></p>

<p class="normal">Putting the word <code>'crowns'</code> in the name 
lists of the crown objects is not quite right, because the parser will 
still think that &#8220;crowns&#8221; might refer to a single
specific item. Instead, put in the word <code>'crowns//p'</code>. The 
suffix <code>//p</code> marks out the dictionary word &#8220;crowns&#8221; 
as one that can refer to more than one game object at once. (So that 
you shouldn't set this for the word &#8220;grapes&#8221; if a bunch
<a id="p224" name="p224"></a>
of grapes is a single game object; you should give that object the 
<code>pluralname</code> attribute instead, as in <a href="s26.html">&#167;26</a> 
back at the start of this chapter.) For example the <code>GoldCoin</code> 
class would read:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class GoldCoin
  with name 'gold' 'coin' 'coins//p',
       short_name &quot;gold coin&quot;,
       plural &quot;gold coins&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Now when the player types &#8220;take coins&#8221;, the 
parser interprets this as &#8220;take all the coins within reach&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The only snag is that now the word <code>'coins'</code> is marked as 
<code>//p</code> everywhere in the game, in all circumstances. Here is 
a more complicated way to achieve the same result, but strictly in 
context of these objects alone. We need to make the <code>parse_name</code> 
routine tell the parser that yes, there was a match, but that it was a 
plural. The way to do this is to set <code>parser_action</code> to 
<code>##PluralFound</code>, another special value. So, for example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class Crown
  with parse_name [ i j;
           for (::) {
               j = NextWord();
               if (j == 'crown' or self.name) i++;
               else {
                   if (j == 'crowns') {
                       parser_action = ##PluralFound; i++;
                   }
                   else return i;
               }
           }
       ];
</pre>

<p class="aside">This code assumes that the crown objects have just 
one name each, their colours.</p>

Write a &#8216;cherub&#8217; class so that if the player tries to call 
them &#8220;cherubs&#8221;, a message like &#8220;I'll let this go once, 
but the plural of cherub is cherubim&#8221; appears.</p>

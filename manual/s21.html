<blockquote>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br>

To recap on <a href="s4.html">&#167;4</a>, an &#8220;entry point 
routine&#8221; is one provided by your own source code which the 
library may call from time to time. There are about twenty of these, 
listed in <a href="sa5.html">&#167;A5</a>, and all of them are 
optional but one: <code>Initialise</code>. This routine is called 
before any text of the game is printed, and it can do many things: 
start timers and daemons, set the time of day, equip the player with 
possessions, make any random settings needed and so on. It <em>usually</em> 
prints out some welcoming text, though not the name and author of 
the game, because that appears soon after when the &#8220;game 
banner&#8221; is printed. The only thing it must do is to set the
<code>location</code> variable to where the player begins.</p>

<p class="indent">This is usually a room, possibly in darkness, but 
might instead be an <code>enterable</code> object inside a room, 
such as a chair or a bed. Like medieval romance epics, interactive 
fiction games often start by waking the player from sleep, sometimes by 
way of a dream sequence. If your game begins with verbose instructions 
before the first opportunity for a player to type a command, you may 
want to offer the chance to restore a saved game at once:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
print &quot;Would you like to restore a game? &gt;&quot;;
if (YesOrNo()) &lt;Restore&gt;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">To equip the player with possessions, simply move 
the relevant objects to <code>player</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">The return value from <code>Initialise</code> is 
ordinarily ignored, whether <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, 
and the library goes on to print the game banner. If, however, you
return 2, the game banner is suppressed for now. This feature is 
provided for games like &#8216;Sorcerer&#8217; and &#8216;Seastalker&#8217; 
which play out a short prelude first. If you do suppress the banner 
from <code>Initialise</code>, you should print it no more than a 
few turns later on by calling the library routine <code>Banner</code>. 
The banner is familiar to players, reassuringly traditional and 
useful when testing, because it identifies which version of a game 
is giving trouble. Like an imprint page with an ISBN, it is invaluable 
to bibliographers and collectors of story files.</p>

<p class="normal">&#8216;Ruins&#8217; opens in classical fashion:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ Initialise;
  TitlePage();

  &quot;^^^Days of searching, days of thirsty hacking through the briars of
  the forest, but at last your patience was rewarded. A discovery!^&quot;;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">For the source code of the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; 
<code>TitlePage</code> routine, see the exercises in 
<a href="s42.html">&#167;42</a>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The question &#8220;where is the player?&#8221; 
can be answered in three different ways. Looking at <code>parent(player)</code> 
tells you the object immediately containing the player, which can 
be a location but might instead be a chair or vehicle. So a condition 
such as:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (player in Bridleway) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">would be <code>false</code> if the player were riding 
a horse through the Bridleway. The safer alternative is:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (location == Bridleway) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">but even this would be <code>false</code> if the 
Bridleway were in darkness, because then <code>location</code> would 
be the special object <code>thedark</code> (see <a href="s19.html">&#167;19</a>). 
The definitive location value is stored in <code>real_location</code>, 
so that:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (real_location == Bridleway) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">works in all cases. The condition for &#8220;is 
the player in a dark Bridleway?&#8221; is:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (location == thedark &amp;&amp; real_location == Bridleway) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">Except for the one time in <code>Initialise</code>, 
you should not attempt to change either of these variables, nor to move 
the player-object by hand. One safe way to move the player in your 
own source code is to cause actions like</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">&lt;Go n_obj&gt;;</pre>

<a id="p164" name="p164"></a>
<p class="normal">but for moments of teleportation it's easier to 
use the library routine <code>PlayerTo</code>. Calling <code>PlayerTo(somewhere)</code> 
makes the parent-object of the player <code>somewhere</code> and 
adjusts the <code>location</code> variables accordingly: it also runs 
through a fair number of standard game rules, for instance checking 
the light level and performing a <code>Look</code> action to print 
out the new room description. The value <code>somewhere</code> can 
be a room, or an <code>enterable</code> object such as a cage or 
a traction-engine, provided that the cardinal rule is always observed:</p>

<p class="aside" style="margin-left:30px">The parent of the player 
object must at all times be &#8220;location-like&#8221;. An object 
is &#8220;location-like&#8221; if either it is a location, or it has 
<code>enterable</code> and its parent is location-like.</p>

<p class="normal">In other words, you can't put the player in an 
<code>enterable</code> cardboard box if that box is itself shut up in 
a free-standing safe which isn't <code>enterable</code>. And you
can't <code>PlayerTo(nothing)</code> or <code>PlayerTo(thedark)</code> 
because <code>nothing</code> is not an object and <code>thedark</code> 
is not location-like.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Calling <code>PlayerTo(somewhere,1)</code> moves the player without 
printing any room description. All other standard game rules are applied.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Calling <code>PlayerTo(somewhere,2)</code> is just like <code>PlayerTo(somewhere)</code> 
except that the room description is in the form the player would expect 
from typing &#8220;go east&#8221; rather than from typing &#8220;look&#8221;. 
The only difference is that in the former case the room is (normally) 
given an abbreviated description if it has been visited before, whereas 
in the latter case the description is always given in full.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
It's perhaps worth taking a moment to say what the standard rules upon 
changing location are. The following rules are applied whenever a <code>Look</code> 
action or a call to <code>PlayerTo</code> take place.</p>

<ol type="1" start="0">
<li><!-- (0) -->If <code>PlayerTo</code> has been called then the <code>parent</code> 
of the player, <code>location</code> and <code>real_location</code> 
are set.</li>
<li><!-- (1) -->Any object providing <code>found_in</code> is checked. If it 
claims to be <code>found_in</code> the location, it is moved to that 
location. If not, or if it has <code>absent</code>, it is removed 
from the object tree. (See <a href="s8.html">&#167;8</a>.)</li>
<li><!-- (2) -->The availability of light is checked (see <a href="s19.html">&#167;19</a>), 
and <code>location</code> is set to <code>thedark</code> if necessary.</li>
<li><!-- (3) -->The &#8220;visibility ceiling&#8221; of the player is determined. 
For instance, the <i>VC</i> for a player in a closed wooden box is 
the box, but for a player in a closed glass box it's the location. 
To be more exact:
 <ol type="a">
 <li><!-- (a) -->The <i>VC</i> of a room is the value of <code>location</code>, 
 i.e., either <code>thedark</code> or the room object.</li>
 <li><!-- (b) -->If the parent of an object is a room or is &#8220;see-through&#8221; (see 
 <a href="s19.html">&#167;19</a> for this definition), the <i>VC</i> 
 of the object is the <i>VC</i> of the parent.</li>
 <li><a id="p165" name="p165"></a><!-- (c) -->If not, the <i>VC</i> of the object is its parent.</li>
 </ol></li>
<li><!-- (4) -->If the <i>VC</i> is <code>thedark</code> or (say) a box, skip 
this rule. Otherwise: if the <i>VC</i> has changed since the
<em>previous</em> time that rule (3) produced a <i>VC</i> which wasn't 
an <code>enterable</code> object, then:
 <ol type="a">
 <li><!-- (a) -->The message <code>location.initial()</code> is sent, if 
 the location provides an <code>initial</code> rule. If the library finds that the 
 player has been moved in the course of running <code>initial</code>, it 
 goes back to rule (3).</li>
 <li><!-- (b) -->The game's entry point routine <code>NewRoom</code> is 
 called, if it provides one.</li>
 </ol></li>
<li><!-- (5) -->The room description is printed out, unless these rules are 
being gone through by <code>PlayerTo(somewhere,1)</code>. For exactly 
what happens in printing a room description, see <a href="s26.html">&#167;26</a>.</li>
<li><!-- (6) -->If the <code>location</code> doesn't have <code>visited</code>, 
give it this attribute and award the player <code>ROOM_SCORE</code> 
points if the <code>location</code> has <code>scored</code>. 
(See <a href="s22.html">&#167;22</a>.) Note that this rule looks 
at <code>location</code>, not <code>real_location</code>, so no points 
unless the room is visible.</li>
</ol>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In the course of this chapter, rules to interfere 
with actions have been attached to items, rooms and people, but not 
yet to the player. In <a href="s18.html">&#167;18</a> it was set out 
that an order like &#8220;austin, eat tuna&#8221; would result in the 
action <code>Eat tuna</code> being passed to <code>austin.orders</code>, 
and heavy hints were dropped that orders and actions are more or 
less the same thing. This is indeed so, and the player's own object 
has an <code>orders</code> routine. This normally does nothing and 
always returns <code>false</code> to mean &#8220;carry on as usual&#8221;, 
but you can install a rule of your own instead:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">player.orders = MyNewRule;</pre>

<p class="normal">where <code>MyNewRule</code> is a new <code>orders</code> 
rule. This rule is applied to every action or order issued by the player. 
The variable actor holds the person asked to do something, usually 
but not always <code>player</code>, and the variables <code>action</code>, 
<code>noun</code> and <code>second</code> are set up as usual. For 
instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table border="1" style="margin-left:30px;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em">
<tr><td><i>Example command</i></td>
 <td><code>actor</code></td>
 <td><code>action</code></td>
 <td><code>noun</code></td>
 <td><code>second</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>&#8220;put tuna in dish&#8221;</td>
 <td><code>player</code></td>
 <td><code>Insert</code></td>
 <td><code>tuna</code></td>
 <td><code>dish</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>&#8220;austin, eat tuna&#8221;</td>
 <td><code>Austin</code></td>
 <td><code>Eat</code></td>
 <td><code>tuna</code></td>
 <td><code>nothing</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p class="normal">For instance, if a cannon goes off right next to the 
player, a period of partial deafness might ensue:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ MyNewRule;

  Listen: &quot;Your hearing is still weak from all that cannon-fire.&quot;;
  default: rfalse;
];
</pre>

<a id="p166" name="p166"></a>
<p class="normal">The <code>if</code> statement needs to be there 
to prevent commands like &#8220;helena, listen&#8221; from being 
ruled out &#8211; after all, the player can still speak.</p>

<b><a href="sa6.html#ans51">EXERCISE 51</a></b></span><br>

(Cf. &#8216;Curses&#8217;.) Write an <code>orders</code> routine for 
the player so that wearing a gas mask will prevent speech.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The <code>player</code> object can not only be 
altered but switched altogether, allowing the player to play from 
the perspective of someone or something else at any point in the 
game. The player who tampers with Dr Frankenstein's brain transference
machine may suddenly become the Monster strapped to the table. A 
player who drinks too much wine could become a drunk player object 
to whom many different rules apply. The &#8220;snavig&#8221; spell 
of &#8216;Spellbreaker&#8217;, which transforms the player to an 
animal like the one cast upon, could be implemented thus. Similarly 
the protagonist of &#8216;Suspended&#8217;, who telepathically runs 
a weather-control station by acting through six sensory robots, 
Iris, Waldo, Sensa, Auda, Poet and Whiz. In a less original setting, 
a player might have a team of four adventurers exploring a labyrinth, 
and be able to switch the one being controlled by typing the name. 
In this case, an <code>AfterLife</code> routine (see below) may be 
needed to switch the focus back to a still-living member of the team
after one has met a sticky end.</p>

<p class="indent">The library routine <code>ChangePlayer(obj)</code> transforms 
the player to <code>obj</code>. Any object can be used for this. There's 
no need to give it any name, as the parser always understands pronouns 
like &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;myself&#8221; to refer to the current
player-object. You may want to set its description, as this is the text 
printed if the player types &#8220;examine myself&#8221;, or its 
<code>capacity</code>, the maximum number of items which this form 
of the player can carry. Finally, this player-object can have its 
own <code>orders</code> property and thus its own rules about what 
it can and can't do.</p>

<p class="indent">As <code>ChangePlayer</code> prints nothing, you 
may want to follow the call with a <code>&lt;&lt;Look&gt;&gt;;</code> action.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
You can call <code>ChangePlayer</code> as part of a game's <code>Initialise</code> 
routine, but if so then you should do this before setting <code>location</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Calling <code>ChangePlayer(obj,1);</code> does the same except that 
it makes the game print &#8220;(as Whoever)&#8221; during subsequent 
room descriptions.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The body dispossessed remains where it was, in play, unless you move 
it away or otherwise dispose of it. The player-object which the player 
begins with is a library-defined object called <code>selfobj</code>, and is 
described in room descriptions as &#8220;your former self&#8221;.</p>

In Central American legend, a sorceror can transform himself into a 
<i>nagual</i>, a familiar such as a spider-monkey; indeed, each individual 
has an animal self or <i>wayhel</i>, living in a volcanic land over 
which the king, as a jaguar, rules. Turn the player into <i>wayhel</i>
form.</p>

Alter the Wormcast of &#8216;Ruins&#8217; (previously defined in 
<a href="s9.html">&#167;9</a>) so that when in <i>wayhel</i> form,

To complete the design of this sequence from &#8216;Ruins&#8217;, 
place a visible iron cage above the hidden burial shaft. The cage 
contains skeletons and a warning written in glyphs, but the player 
who enters it despite these (and they all will) passes into <i>wayhel</i> 
life. (The transformed body is unable to move the sodium lamp, but 
has nocturnal vision, so doesn't need to.) Unfortunately the player 
is now outside a cage which has closed around the human self which 
must be returned to, while the <i>wayhel</i> lacks the dexterity
to open the cage. The solution is to use the Wormcast to reach the 
Burial Chamber, then bring its earthen roof down, opening a connection 
between the chamber below and the cage above. Recovering human form, 
the player can take the grave goods, climb up into the cage, open it 
from the inside and escape. Lara Croft would be proud.</p>

The situation becomes a little complicated if the same <code>orders</code> 
routine has to do service in two situations: once while its owner is a 
character met in the course of play, and then a second time when the 
player has changed into it. This could be done simply by changing the 
value of <code>orders</code> when the transformation takes place, 
but an alternative is to arrange code for a single <code>orders</code> 
routine like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
orders [;
    if (player == self) {
        if (actor == self) {
            ! I give myself an action
        }
        else {
            ! I give someone else an order
        }
    }<a id="p168" name="p168"></a>
    else {
        ! Someone else gives me an order
    }
],

Write an <code>orders</code> routine for a Giant with a conscience,

<p class="normal">&#8220;There are only three events in a man's life; 
birth, life and death; he is not conscious of being born, he dies in 
pain and he forgets to live.&#8221; (Jean de la Bruy&egrave;re again.) 
Death is indeed the usual conclusion of an adventure game, and occurs 
when the source code sets the library variable <code>deadflag</code> 
to <code>true</code>: in normal play <code>deadflag</code> is always 
<code>false</code>. The &#8220;standard Inform rules&#8221; never
lead to the player's death, so this is something the designer must 
explicitly do.</p>

<p class="indent">Unlike life, however, interactive fiction offers 
another way out: the player can win. This happens if and when the 
variable <code>deadflag</code> is set to 2.</p>

<p class="indent">Any higher values of <code>deadflag</code> are 
considered to be more exotic ways the game can end, requiring text 
beyond &#8220;You have died&#8221; or &#8220;You have won&#8221;.
The Inform library doesn't know what this text should be, so it 
calls the <code>DeathMessage</code> entry point routine, which 
is expected to look at <code>deadflag</code> and can then print 
something suitable. For instance, &#8216;Ruins&#8217; has a chasm 
subject to the following <code>before</code> rule:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
before [;
    Enter: deadflag = 3;
        &quot;You plummet through the silent void of darkness, cracking
        your skull against an outcrop of rock. Amid the pain and
        redness, you dimly make out the God with the
        Owl-Headdress...&quot;;
    JumpOver: &quot;It is far too wide.&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">and this means that it needs a <code>DeathMessage</code> 
routine like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ DeathMessage;
      if (deadflag == 3) 
          print &quot;You have been captured&quot;;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">Capture was about the worst fate that could befall 
you in the unspeakably inhumane world of Maya strife.</p>

<a id="p169" name="p169"></a>
<p class="indent">&#8216;Ruins&#8217; doesn't, but many games allow 
reincarnation or, as David M. Baggett points out, in fact resurrection. 
You too can allow this, by providing an <code>AfterLife</code> entry 
point routine. This gets the chance to do as it pleases before 
any &#8220;death message&#8221; is printed, and it can even reset 
<code>deadflag</code> to <code>false</code>, causing the game to 
resume as though nothing had happened. Such <code>AfterLife</code> 
routines can be tricky to write, though, because the game often has
to be altered to reflect what has happened.</p>

<h2>&#167;9 &nbsp; Directions and the map</h2>

<blockquote>I wisely started with a map, and made the story fit 
(generally with meticulous care for distances). The other way about 
lands one in confusions and impossibilities, and in any case it is 
weary work to compose a map from a story &#8211; as I fear you have found.<br>
&#8212; J. R. R. Tolkien (1892&#8211;1973), to Naomi Mitchison, 
25 April 1954</blockquote>

&#8216;Ruins&#8217; so far contains two disconnected rooms. It is 
time to extend it into a modest map in which, as promised, the Square 
Chamber lies underneath the original Forest location. For the map 
of the finished game, see <a href="s23.html">&#167;23</a> below, 
but here is the beginning of the first level beneath ground, showing 
the Square Chamber and its two main side-chambers:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table align="center" class="objtree">
<tr><td><tt>Square Chamber</tt></td>
 <td>&#8212;</td>
 <td><tt>Wormcast</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="4"></tr>
<tr><td><tt>Corridor</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>Shrine</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p class="normal">To make these map connections, we need to add:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">u_to Forest, e_to Wormcast, s_to Corridor,</pre>

<p class="normal">to the Square Chamber. This seems a good point to 
add two more map connections, or rather non-connections, to the Forest 
as well:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
u_to &quot;The trees are spiny and you'd cut your hands to ribbons
    trying to climb them.&quot;,
cant_go &quot;The rainforest is dense, and you haven't hacked
    through it for days to abandon your discovery now. Really,
    you need a good few artifacts to take back to civilization
    before you can justify giving up the expedition.&quot;,
</pre>

<p class="normal">The property <code>cant_go</code> contains what 
is printed when the player tries to go in a nonexistent direction, 
and replaces &#8220;You can't go that way&#8221;. Instead of
giving an actual message you can give a routine to print one out, 
to vary what's printed with the circumstances. The Forest needs a 
<code>cant_go</code> because in real life one could go in every 
direction from there: what we're doing is explaining the game 
rules to the player: go underground, find some ancient treasure, 
then get out to win. The Forest's <code>u_to</code> property is 
a string of text, not a room, and this means that attempts to go 
up result only in that string being printed.</p>

<a id="p123" name="p123"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Here's how this is done. When the library wants to go in a certain 
direction, let's say &#8220;north&#8221;, it sends the message 
<code>location.n_to()</code> and looks at the reply: it takes
<code>false</code> to mean &#8220;Player can't go that way&#8221; and 
says so; <code>true</code> means &#8220;Player can't go that way, 
and I've already said why&#8221;; and any other value is taken as 
the destination.</p>

Many early games have rooms with confused exits: &#8216;Advent&#8217; 
has Bedquilt, &#8216;Acheton&#8217; has a magnetic lodestone which 
throws the compass into confusion, &#8216;Zork II&#8217; has a
spinning carousel room and so on. Make the Wormcast room in 
&#8216;Ruins&#8217; similarly bewildering.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">For each of the twelve standard Inform directions 
there is a &#8220;direction property&#8221;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
n_to     s_to     e_to     w_to     d_to     u_to
ne_to    nw_to    se_to    sw_to    in_to    out_to
</pre>

<p class="normal">Each direction also has a &#8220;direction object&#8221; 
to represent it in the game. For instance, <code>n_obj</code> is 
the object whose name is &#8220;north&#8221; and which the player
invokes by typing &#8220;go north&#8221; or just &#8220;n&#8221;. 
So there are normally twelve of these, too:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
n_obj    s_obj    e_obj    w_obj    d_obj    u_obj
ne_obj   nw_obj   se_obj   sw_obj   in_obj   out_obj
</pre>

<p class="normal">Confusing the direction objects with the direction 
properties is easily done, but they are quite different. When the 
player types &#8220;go north&#8221;, the action is <code>Go n_obj</code>, 
with <code>noun</code> being <code>n_obj</code>: only when this action 
has survived all possible before rules is the <code>n_to</code> value 
of the current location looked at.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The set of direction objects is not fixed: the current direction 
objects are the children of a special object called <code>compass</code>, 
and the game designer is free to add to or take from the current 
stock. Here for instance is the definition of &#8220;north&#8221; 
made by the library:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
CompassDirection n_obj &quot;north wall&quot; compass
  with name 'n' 'north' 'wall', door_dir n_to;
</pre>

<p class="aside"><code>CompassDirection</code> is a class defined 
by the library for direction objects. <code>door_dir</code> is
a property more usually seen in the context of doors (see 
<a href="s13.html">&#167;13</a>) and here tells Inform which 
direction property corresponds to which direction object.</p>

In the first millennium A.D., the Maya peoples of the Yucat&aacute;n 
Peninsula had &#8216;world colours&#8217; white (<i>sac</i>), 
red (<i>chac</i>), yellow (<i>kan</i>) and black (<i>chikin</i>) 
for what we call the compass bearings north, east, south, west 
(for instance west is associated with &#8216;sunset&#8217;, hence 
black, the colour of night). Implement this.</p>

In Level 9's version of &#8216;Advent&#8217;, the magic word &#8220;xyzzy&#8221; 
was implemented as a thirteenth direction. How can this be done?</p>

(Cf. &#8216;Trinity&#8217;.) How can the entire game map be 
suddenly east­west reflected?</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans12">EXERCISE 12</a></b></span><br>
Even when the map is reflected, there may be many room descriptions 
referring to &#8220;east&#8221; and &#8220;west&#8221; by name. 
Reflect these too.</p>

Some designers find it a nuisance to have to keep specifying all 
map connections twice: once east from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, then a second time 
west from <i>B</i> to <i>A</i>, for instance. Write some code to go in the 
<code>Initialise</code> routine making all connections automatically 
two-way.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>

&#8216;Advent&#8217; has a very tangled-up map in places (see the 
mazes) and a well-constructed exterior of forest and valley giving 
an impression of space with remarkably few rooms. The mist object uses 
<code>found_in</code> to the full, and see also the stream (a single 
object representing every watercourse in the game). Bedquilt and 
the Swiss Cheese room offer classic confused-exit puzzles. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>For a simple movement rule 
using <code>e_to</code>, see the Office in &#8216;Toyshop&#8217;. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>The opening location of Infocom's 
&#8216;Moonmist&#8217; provides a good example of <code>cant_go</code> used 
to guide the player in a tactful way: &#8220;(The castle is south of 
here.)&#8221; &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>The library extension <tt>&quot;smartcantgo.h&quot;</tt> 
by David Wagner provides a system for automatically printing out 
&#8220;You can only go east and north.&#8221;-style messages.
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Ricardo Dague's <tt>&quot;cmap.h&quot;</tt> 
constructs maps of American-style cities. The same author's <tt>&quot;makemaze.inf&quot;</tt> 
prints out Inform source code for random rectangular mazes.
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Nicholas Daley and Gunther Schmidl 
have each independently written a <tt>&quot;dirs.h&quot;</tt> 
providing a &#8220;dirs&#8221; or &#8220;exits&#8221; verb which 
lists available exits. Marnie Parker's <tt>&quot;dirsmap.h&quot;</tt> 
goes further by plotting up exits in map style or writing them out 
in English, at the player's discretion. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Brian D. Smith's example program 
<tt>&quot;spin.inf&quot;</tt> abolishes the convention that a player 
has an in-built ability to know which way is north: it replaces conventional 
compass directions with &#8220;left&#8221;, &#8220;right&#8221;, 
&#8220;ahead&#8221; and &#8220;back&#8221;.</p>

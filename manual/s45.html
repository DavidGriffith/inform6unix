<h2>&#167;45 &nbsp; Limitations and getting around them</h2>

<blockquote>How wide the limits stand<br>
Between a splendid and an happy land.<br>
&#8212; Oliver Goldsmith (1728&#8211;1774), <i>The Deserted Village</i></blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-344_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
The Z-machine is well-designed, and has three major advantages: it is 
compact, widely portable and can be quickly executed. Nevertheless, 
like any rigidly defined format it imposes limitations. This section 
is intended to help those few designers who encounter the current limits. 
Some of the economy-measures below may sound like increasingly desperate 
manoeuvres in a lost battle, but if so then the cavalry is on its way: 
Andrew Plotkin has written a hybrid version of Inform which removes
almost every restriction. Although it doesn't quite have all the nooks 
and crannies of Inform yet working, it does allow most games to compile 
without difficulty to a very much larger virtual machine than the 
Z-machine called &#8220;glulx&#8221;.</p>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">1. <i>Story file size.</i>&nbsp;
The maximum size of a story file (in K) is given by:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table id="s45_tbl1" align="center">
<tr class="row1"><td>V3</td><td>V4</td><td>V5</td><td>V6</td><td>V7</td><td>V8</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>256</td><td>256</td><td>512</td><td>320</td><td>512</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="normal">Because the centralised library of Inform is efficient in 
terms of not duplicating code, even 128K allows for a game at least half 
as large again as a typical old-style Infocom game. Inform is normally 
used only to produce story files of Versions 5, 6 and 8. Version 5 
is the default; Version 6 should be used where pictures or other graphical 
features are essential to the game; Version 8 is a size extension for 
Version 5, allowing games of fairly gargantuan proportions.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
If story file memory does become short, a standard mechanism can save 
about 8­10% of the total memory, though it will not greatly affect readable 
memory extent. Inform does not usually trouble with this economy measure, 
since there's very seldom any need, and it makes the compiler run about 
10% slower. What you need to do is define abbreviations and then run 
the compiler in its &#8220;economy&#8221; mode (using the switch <tt>-e</tt>). 
For instance, the directive</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Abbreviate &quot; the &quot;;</pre>

<p class="aside">(placed before any text appears) will cause the string 
&#8220; the &#8221; to be internally stored as a single &#8216;letter&#8217;, 
saving memory every time it occurs (about 2,500 times in &#8216;Curses&#8217;, for 
<a id="p345" name="p345"></a>
instance). You can have up to 64 abbreviations. When choosing abbreviations, 
avoid proper nouns and instead pick on short combinations of a space and common 
two- or three-letter blocks. Good choices include <tt>&quot; the &quot;</tt>, 
<tt>&quot;The &quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;, &quot;</tt>, 
<tt>&quot; and &quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;you&quot;</tt>, 
<tt>&quot; a &quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;ing &quot;</tt>, 
<tt>&quot; to&quot;</tt>. You can even get Inform to work out by itself 
what a good stock of abbreviations would be, by setting the <tt>-u</tt> 
switch: but be warned, this makes the compiler run about 29,000% slower.</p>
</div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2. <i>Readable memory size.</i>&nbsp;
In a very large game, or even a small one if it uses unusually large 
or very many arrays, the designer may run up against the following 
Inform fatal error message:</p>

<p class="output">This program has overflowed the maximum readable-memory 
size of the Z-machine format. See the memory map below: the start of 
the area marked &#8220;above readable memory&#8221; must be brought 
down to $10000 or less.</p>

<p class="normal">In other words, the readable-memory area is absolutely 
limited to 65,536 bytes in all Versions. Using the <tt>-D</tt> debugging 
option increases the amount of readable-memory consumed, and the Infix 
<tt>-X</tt> switch increases this further yet. (For instance &#8216;Advent&#8217; 
normally uses 24,820 bytes, but 25,276 with <tt>-D</tt> and 28,908 
with <tt>-X</tt>.) The following table suggests what is, and what 
is not, worth economising on.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table border="1" align="center" id="s45_tbl2">
<tr><td><i>Each &#8230;</i></td><td><i>Costs &#8230;</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Routine</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Text in double-quotes</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Object or class</td><td>26</td></tr>
<tr><td>Common property value</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Non-common property value</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>If a property holds an array</td><td>add 2 for each entry after the first</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dictionary word</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Verb</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Different action</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grammar token</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>--&gt;</code> or <code>table</code> array entry</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-&gt;</code> or <code>string</code> array entry</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="normal">To draw some morals: verbs, actions, grammar and the 
dictionary consume little readable memory and are too useful to economise 
on. Objects and arrays are where savings can be made. Here is one 
strategy for doing so.</p>
</div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2a. <i>Economise on arrays.</i>&nbsp;
Many programmers create arrays with more entries than needed, saying 
in effect &#8220;I'm not sure how many this will take, but it's bound 
to be less than 1,000, so I'll say 1,000 entries to be on the safe
<a id="p346" name="p346"></a>
side.&#8221; More thought will often reduce the number. If not, look at 
the typical contents. Are the possible values always between 0 and 255? 
If so, make it a <code>-&gt;</code> or <code>string</code> array and 
the consumption of readable memory is halved. Are the possible values 
always <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>? If so, Adam Cadre's 
<tt>&quot;flags.h&quot;</tt> library extension offers a slower-access 
form of array but which consumes only about 1/8th of a byte of readable 
memory per array entry.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2b. <i>Turn arrays of constants into routines.</i>&nbsp;
Routines cost nothing in readable memory terms, but they can still store 
information as long as it doesn't need to vary during play. For instance, 
&#8216;Curses&#8217; contains an array beginning:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Array RadioSongs table
  &quot;Queen's ~I Want To Break Free~.&quot;
  &quot;Bach's ~Air on a G-string~.&quot;
  &quot;Mozart's ~Musical Joke~.&quot;
</pre>

<p class="normal">and so on for dozens more easy-listening songs which 
sometimes play on Aunt Jemima's radio. It might equally be a routine:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ RadioSongs n;
  switch (n) {
      0: return 100; ! Number of songs
      1: return &quot;Queen's ~I Want To Break Free~.&quot;;
      2: return &quot;Bach's ~Air on a G-string~.&quot;;
      3: return &quot;Mozart's ~Musical Joke~.&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">and so on. Instead of reading <code>RadioSongs--&gt;x</code>, 
one now reads <code>RadioSongs(x)</code>. Not an elegant trick, but it 
saves 200 bytes of readable memory.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2c. <i>Economise on object properties.</i>&nbsp;
Each time an object provides a property, readable memory is used. This 
is sometimes worth bearing in mind when writing definitions of classes 
which will have many members. For instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class Doubloon(100)
 with name 'gold' 'golden' 'spanish' 'doubloon' 'coin' 'money'
           'coins//p' 'doubloons//p',
      ...
</pre>

<p class="normal">Each of the hundred doubloons has a <code>name</code> 
array with eight entries, so 1700 bytes of readable memory are consumed. 
This could be reduced to 300 like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class Doubloon(100)
 with parse_name [;
      ! A routine detecting the same name-words
      ...
      ],
</pre>
</div>

<a id="p347" name="p347"></a>
<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2d. <i>Make commonly occurring properties common.</i>&nbsp;
Recall that properties declared with the <code>Property</code> directive 
are called &#8220;common properties&#8221;: these are faster to access 
and consume less memory. If, for instance, each of 100 rooms in your 
game provides a property called <code>time_zone</code>, then the 
declaration</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Property time_zone;</pre>

<p class="normal">at the start of your code will save 2 bytes each 
time <code>time_zone</code> is provided, saving 200 bytes in all. 
(The library's properties are all common already.)</p>
</div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2e. <i>Economise on objects.</i>&nbsp;
In a room with four scenery objects irrelevant to the action, say 
a window, a chest of drawers, a bed and a carpet, is it strictly necessary 
for each to have its own object? Kathleen Fischer: &#8220;<code>parse_name</code>
is your friend&#8230; a single object with an elaborate <code>parse_name</code> 
can be used to cover a whole lot of scenery.&#8221; In Kathleen's technique, 
it would use <code>parse_name</code> to record which of the words 
&#8220;window&#8221;, &#8220;chest&#8221;, &#8220;bed&#8221; or
&#8220;carpet&#8221; was used, storing that information in a property: 
other properties, like <code>description</code>, would be routines which 
produced text depending on what the object is representing this turn.</p>
</div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">2f. <i>Reuse objects.</i>&nbsp;
This is a last resort but L. Ross Raszewski's <tt>&quot;imem.h&quot;</tt> 
has helped several designers through it. Briefly, just as an array was 
converted to a routine in (1) above, <tt>&quot;imem.h&quot;</tt> converts 
object definitions to routines, with a minimal number of them &#8220;swapped 
in&#8221; as real objects at any given time and the rest &#8211; items 
of scenery in distant locations, for instance &#8211; &#8220;swapped 
out&#8221;.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">3. <i>Grammar.</i>&nbsp;
There can be up to 256 essentially different verbs, each with up to 32 
grammar lines. Using the <code>UnknownVerb</code> entry point will get 
around the former limit, and general parsing routines can make even 
a single grammar line match almost any range of syntax.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">4. <i>Vocabulary.</i>&nbsp;
There is no theoretical limit except that the dictionary words
each take up 9 bytes of readable memory, which means that 4,000 words 
is probably the practical limit. In practice games generally have 
vocabularies of between 500 and 2,000 words.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">5. <i>Dictionary resolution.</i>&nbsp;
Dictionary words are truncated to their first 9 letters (except 
that non-alphabetic characters, such as hyphens, count as 2 &#8220;letters&#8221;
for this purpose: look up <code>Zcharacter</code> in the index for references 
to more on this). Upper and lower case letters are considered equal. 
Since general parsing routines, or <code>parse_name</code> routines, can 
look at the exact text typed by the player, finer resolution is easy 
enough if needed.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">6. <i>Attributes, properties, names.</i>&nbsp;
There can be up to 48 attributes and an unlimited number of properties, 
at most 63 of these can be made common by 
<a id="p348" name="p348"></a>
being declared with 
<code>Property</code>. A property entry can hold up to 64 bytes of data. 
Hence, for example, an object can have up to 32 <code>name</code>s. If an 
object must respond to more, give it a suitable <code>parse_name</code> 
routine.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">7. <i>Objects and classes.</i>&nbsp;
The number of objects is unlimited so long as there is readable 
memory to hold their definitions. The number of classes is presently
limited to 256, of which the library uses only 1.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">8. <i>Global variables.</i>&nbsp;
There can only be 240 of these, and the Inform compiler uses 5 as scratch 
space, while the library uses slightly over 100; but since a typical 
game uses only a dozen of its own, code being almost always object-oriented, 
the restriction is never felt.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">9. <i>Arrays.</i>&nbsp;
An unlimited number of <code>Array</code> statements is permitted, 
although the entries in arrays consume readable memory (see above).</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">10. <i>Function calls and messages.</i>&nbsp;
A function can be called with at most seven arguments. A message can 
be called with at most five.</p></div>

<div class="clump"><p class="normal">11. <i>Recursion and stack usage.</i>&nbsp;
The limit on this is rather technical (see <i>The Z-Machine 
Standards Document</i>). Roughly speaking, recursion is permitted 
to a depth of 90 routines in almost all circumstances, and often much 
deeper. Direct usage of the stack via assembly language must be modest.</p></div>

<h2>&#167;38 &nbsp; Controlling compilation from within</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-288_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Inform has a number of directives for controlling which pieces of
source code are compiled: for instance, you can divide your source
code into several files, compiled together or separately, or you can
write source code in which different passages will be compiled on
different occasions. Most of these directives are seldom seen, but almost every
game uses:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Include &quot;filename&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">which instructs Inform to glue the whole of that source 
code file into the program right here. It is exactly equivalent to removing 
the <code>Include</code> directive and replacing it with the whole file 
<tt>&quot;filename&quot;</tt>. (The rules for how Inform interprets 
<tt>&quot;filename&quot;</tt> vary from machine to machine: for instance, 
it may automatically add an extension such as &#8220;<tt>.inf</tt>&#8221; 
if your operating system normally uses filename extensions and it may 
look in some special directory. Run Inform with the <tt>-h1</tt> switch 
for further information.) Note that you can write</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Include &quot;&gt;shortname&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">to mean &#8220;the file called <tt>&quot;shortname&quot;</tt> 
which is in the same directory that the present file came from&#8221;. 
This is convenient if all the files making up the source code of your 
game are housed together.</p>

<p class="indent">Next, there are a number of &#8220;conditional compilation&#8221; 
directives. They take the general form of a condition:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<a id="p289" name="p289"></a>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td><code>Ifdef</code> &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<code>;</code></td>
 <td>Is &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250; defined as having some meaning?</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Ifndef</code> &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<code>;</code></td>
 <td>Is &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250; undefined?</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Iftrue</code> &#8249;<span class="token">condition</span>&#8250;<code>;</code></td>
 <td>Is this &#8249;<span class="token">condition</span>&#8250; true?</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Iffalse</code> &#8249;<span class="token">condition</span>&#8250;<code>;</code></td>
 <td>Is this &#8249;<span class="token">condition</span>&#8250; false?</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">followed by a chunk of Inform and then, optionally,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Ifnot;</pre>

<p class="normal">and another chunk of Inform; and finally</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Endif;</pre>

<p class="normal">At this point it is perhaps worth mentioning that 
(most) directives can also be interspersed with statements in routine 
declarations, provided they are preceded by a <code>#</code> sign. 
For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ MyRoutine;
#Iftrue MAX_SCORE &gt; 1000;
  print &quot;My, what a long game we're in for!^&quot;;
#Ifnot;
  print &quot;Let's have a quick game, then.^&quot;;
#Endif;
  PlayTheGame();
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">which actually only compiles one of the two print 
statements, according to what the value of the constant <code>MAX_SCORE</code> 
is.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
One kind of &#8220;if-defined&#8221; manoeuvre is so useful that it 
has an abbreviation:</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>Default</code>
&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">value</span>&#8250;<code>;</code></p>

<p class="aside">defines &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;
as a constant if it wasn't already the name of something: so it's 
equivalent to</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>Ifndef</code> 
&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<code>; Constant</code>
&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250; <code>=</code>
&#8249;<span class="token">value</span>&#8250;<code>; Endif;</code></p>

<p class="aside">Similarly, though far less often used, 
<code>Stub &lt;name&gt; &lt;number&gt;;</code> defines a do-nothing
routine with this name and number (0 to 3) of local variables, 
if it isn't already the name of something: it is equivalent to</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>Ifndef</code> 
&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<code>; [</code>
&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250; 
<code>x1 x2</code> &#8230; 
<code>x</code>&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;<code>; ]; Endif;</code></p>

<a id="p290" name="p290"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Large standard chunks of Inform source code are often 
bundled up into &#8220;libraries&#8221; which can be added to any 
Inform story file using the <code>Include</code> directive. Almost 
all Inform adventure games include three library files called
&#8220;Parser&#8221;, &#8220;VerbLib&#8221; and &#8220;Grammar&#8221;, 
and several dozen smaller libraries have also been written. 
Sometimes, though, what you want to do is &#8220;include all of this 
library file except for the definition of <code>SomeRoutine</code>&#8221;. 
You can do this by declaring:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Replace SomeRoutine;</pre>

<p class="normal">before the relevant library file is included. You 
still have to define your own <code>SomeRoutine</code>, hence the 
term &#8220;replace&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
How does Inform know to ignore the <code>SomeRoutine</code> definition 
in the library file, but to accept yours as valid? The answer is that 
a library file is marked out as having routines which can be replaced, 
by containing the directive</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">System_file;</pre>

<p class="aside">All eight of the standard Inform library files (the 
three you normally <code>Include</code> in games, plus the five others 
which they <code>Include</code> for you) begin with this directive. 
It also has the effect of suppressing all compilation warnings 
(but not errors) arising from the file.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">One way to follow what is being compiled is to use the 
<code>Message</code> directive. This makes the compiler print messages 
as it compiles:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Message &quot;An informational message&quot;;
Message error &quot;An error message&quot;;
Message fatalerror &quot;A fatal error message&quot;;
Message warning &quot;A warning message&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Errors, fatal errors and warnings are treated as if 
they had arisen from faults in the source code in the normal way. See 
<a href="s40.html">&#167;40</a> for more about the kinds of error 
Inform can produce, but for now, note that an error or fatal error will 
prevent any story file from being produced, and that messages issued 
by <code>Message warning</code> will be suppressed if they occur in 
a &#8220;system file&#8221; (one that you have marked with a 
<code>System_file</code> directive). Informational messages are
simply printed:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Message &quot;Geometry library by Boris J. Parallelopiped&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">prints this text, followed by a new-line.</p>

<a id="p291" name="p291"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
One reason to use this might be to ensure that a library file fails 
gracefully if it needs to use a feature which was only introduced on 
a later version of the Inform compiler than the one it finds itself 
running through. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Ifndef VN_1610;
Message fatalerror
    &quot;The geometry extension needs Inform 6.1 or later&quot;;
Endif;
</pre>

<p class="aside">By special rule, the condition &#8220;<code>VN_1610</code> 
is defined&#8221; is true if and only if the compiler's release number 
is 6.10 or more; similarly for the previous releases 6.01, first to 
include message-sending, 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05, 6.10, which expanded 
numerous previous limits on grammar, 6.11, 6.12, which allowed Inform 
to read from non-English character sets, 6.13, 6.15, which allowed 
parametrised object creation, 6.20, which introduced strict error checking, 
and finally (so far) 6.21, the first to feature Infix. A full history 
can be found in the <i>Technical Manual</i>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Inform also has the ability to link together separately-compiled 
pieces of story file into the current compilation. This feature is provided 
primarily for users with slowish machines who would sooner not waste time 
compiling the standard Inform library routines over and over again. Linking 
isn't something you can do entirely freely, though, and if you have a fast 
machine you may prefer not to bother with it: the time taken to compile 
a story file is now often dominated by disc access times, so little 
or no time will be saved.</p>

<p class="indent">The pieces of pre-compiled story file are called &#8220;modules&#8221; 
and they cannot be interpreted or used for anything other than linking.</p>

<p class="indent">The process is as follows. A game being compiled (called 
the &#8220;external&#8221; program) may <code>Link</code> one or more 
pre-compiled sections of code called &#8220;modules&#8221;. Suppose 
the game Jekyll has a subsection called Hyde. Then these two methods 
of making Jekyll are, very nearly, equivalent:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>Putting <code>Include &quot;Hyde&quot;;</code> in the source for 
<tt>&quot;Jekyll&quot;</tt>, and compiling <tt>&quot;Jekyll&quot;</tt>.</li>
<li>Compiling <tt>&quot;Hyde&quot;</tt> with the <tt>-M</tt> 
(&#8220;module&#8221;) switch set, then putting <code>Link &quot;Hyde&quot;;</code> 
into the same point in the source for <tt>&quot;Jekyll&quot;</tt>, and 
compiling <tt>&quot;Jekyll&quot;</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="normal">Option (2) is faster as long as <tt>&quot;Hyde&quot;</tt> 
does not change very often, since its ready-compiled module can be 
left lying around while <tt>&quot;Jekyll&quot;</tt> is being developed.</p>

<p class="indent">Because &#8220;linking the library&#8221; is by far 
the most common use of the linker, this is made simple. All you have to 
do is compile your game with the <tt>-U</tt> 
<a id="p292" name="p292"></a>
switch set, or, equivalently, to begin your source code with</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant USE_MODULES;</pre>

<p class="normal">This assumes that you already have pre-compiled copies 
of the two library modules: if not, you'll need to make them with</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
inform -M library/parserm.h
inform -M library/verblibm.h
</pre>

<p class="normal">where <tt>library/parserm.h</tt> should be replaced with 
whatever filename you keep the library file &#8220;<tt>parserm</tt>&#8221; 
in, and likewise for &#8220;<tt>verblibm</tt>&#8221;. This sounds
good, but here are four caveats:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>You can only do this for a game compiled as a Version 5 story file. 
This is the version Inform normally compiles to, but some authors 
of very large games need to use Version 8. Such authors usually have 
relatively fast machines and don't need the marginal speed gain from 
linking rather than including.</li>
<li>It's essential not to make any <code>Attribute</code> or 
<code>Property</code> declarations <em>before</em> the <code>Include 
&quot;Parser&quot;</code> line in the source code, though <em>after</em> 
that point is fine. Inform will warn you if you get this wrong.</li>
<li>Infix debugging, <tt>-X</tt>, is not compatible with linking, and 
strict error checking <tt>-S</tt> does not apply within modules.</li>
<li>The precompiled library modules always include the <tt>-D</tt> 
debugging verbs, so when you come to compile the final release version 
of a game, you'll have to compile it the slow way, i.e., without linking 
the library.</li>
</ol>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
If you intend to write your own pre-compilable library modules, or 
intend to subdivide a large game into many modular parts, you will need 
to know what the limitations are on linking. (In the last recourse you 
may want to look at the <i>Technical Manual</i>.) Here's a brief list:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>The module must make the same <code>Property</code> and 
<code>Attribute</code> directives as the main program and in the 
same order. Including the library file <tt>&quot;linklpa.h&quot;</tt> 
(&#8220;link library properties and attributes&#8221;) declares the 
library's own stock, so it might be sensible to do this first, and 
then include a similar file defining any extra common properties and 
attributes you need.</li>
<li>The module cannot contain grammar (i.e., use <code>Verb</code> 
or <code>Extend</code> directives) or create &#8220;fake actions&#8221;.</li>
<li>The module can only use global variables defined outside the module 
if they are explicitly declared before use using the <code>Import</code> directive. 
For example, writing <code>Import global frog;</code> allows the rest 
of the module's source code to refer to the 
<a id="p293" name="p293"></a>
variable <code>frog</code> 
(which must be defined in the outside program). Note that the Include 
file <tt>&quot;linklv.h&quot;</tt> (&#8220;link library variables&#8221;) 
imports all the library variables, so it would be sensible to include 
this.</li>
<li>An object in the module can't inherit from a class defined outside 
the module. (But an object outside can inherit from a class inside.)</li>
<li>Certain constant values in the module must be known at module-compile-time
(and must not, for instance, be a symbol only defined outside the module). 
For instance: the size of an array must be known now, not later; so 
must the number of duplicate members of a <code>Class</code>; and 
the quantities being compared in an <code>Iftrue</code> or 
<code>Iffalse</code>.</li>
<li>The module can't: define the <code>Main</code> routine; use 
the <code>Stub</code> or <code>Default</code> directives; or define 
an object whose parent object is not also in the same module.</li>
</ol>

<p class="aside">These restrictions are mild in practice. As an example, 
here is a short module to play with:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Include &quot;linklpa&quot;;        ! Make use of the properties, attributes
Include &quot;linklv&quot;;         ! and variables from the Library
[ LitThings x;
  objectloop (x has light)
      print (The) x, &quot; is currently giving off light.^&quot;;
];
</pre>

<p class="aside">It should be possible to compile this <tt>-M</tt> and then 
to <code>Link</code> it into another game, making the routine 
<code>LitThings</code> exist in that game.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Every story file has a release number and a serial 
code. Games compiled with the Inform library print these numbers 
in one line of the &#8220;banner&#8221;. For instance, a game compiled 
in December 1998 might have the banner line:</p>

<p class="output">Release 1 / Serial number 981218 / Inform v6.20 Library 6/8</p>

<p class="normal">The release number is 1 unless otherwise specified with the directive</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Release &lt;number&gt;;</pre>

<p class="normal">This can be any Inform number, but convention is for 
the first published copy of a game to be numbered 1, and releases 2, 
3, 4,&#8230; to be amended re-releases.</p>

<p class="indent">The serial number is set automatically to the date 
of compilation in the form &#8220;yymmdd&#8221;, so that <code>981218</code> means 
&#8220;18th December 1998&#8221; and <code>000101</code> means 
&#8220;1st January 2000&#8221;. You can fix the date differently by setting</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Serial &quot;dddddd&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">where the text must be a string of 6 (decimal) digits. 
Inform's standard example games do this, so that the serial number will 
be the date of last modification of the source code, regardless of 
when the story file is eventually compiled.</p>

<a id="p294" name="p294"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The Inform release number is written into the story file by Inform 
itself, and you can't change it. But you can make the story file print 
out this number with the special statement <code>inversion;</code>.</p>

Inform sources
==============

The 'src' directory contains the source code to Inform, which was taken
from ftp.gmd.de:

    /if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform6/source/inform621_source.zip

with the following changes:

    * header.h:
    Removed the '#define ARCHIMEDES' line.  Machine type is now set via the
    -D compiler option.

    * inform.c:
    Increased size of some static buffers, to cope with extra-long default
    pathname settings.  Changed buffers are now of size PATHLEN, where that
    is #define'd at the top of the file.

    * files.c:
    Same as inform.c.

See 'source.diff' for the explicit diffs.

Inform library
==============

The 'lib' directory contains the Inform library, which taken unchanged from
ftp.gmd.de:

    /if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform6/library/inform_library610.zip 

The standard header files are stored in lower-case here.  Symbolic links to
other semi-standard names get created upon installation (e.g. verblib.h
gets symlinked to Verblib.h and VerbLib.h).  Except on Cygwin, where case
doesn't seem to matter.

Include files
=============

The 'include' directory contains many of the include files that various
people have written for Inform over the years.  Documentation for most of
them is contained in their own files (but there are extra doc files for
some).

Note that only some of these headers have been tested with Inform 6.  If
you find one that doesn't work as advertised, drop me a line and I'll
attempt to fix it (or, if you've already done that, send me the fix!).

As with the library headers, all the header file names have been converted
to lower case.  Converted lowercase files get symlinked to their original
names on installation, for compatibility with old games that use them.

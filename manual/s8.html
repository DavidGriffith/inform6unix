<h2>&#167;8 &nbsp; Places and scenery</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-116_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
In this longer chapter the model world of an Inform game will be
explored and examples will gradually complete the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; 
begun in Chapter II. So far, &#8216;Ruins&#8217; contains just a 
location of rainforest together with some rules about photography. 
The immediate need is for a more substantial map, beginning with a 
sunken chamber. Like the Forest, this too has <code>light</code>, however dim. If 
it didn't, the player would never see it: in Inform's world darkness 
prevails unless the designer provides some kind of lamp or, as in this 
case, ambient light.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object Square_Chamber &quot;Square Chamber&quot;
  with name 'lintelled' 'lintel' 'lintels' 'east' 'south' 'doorways',
       description
           &quot;A sunken, gloomy stone chamber, ten yards across. A shaft
           of sunlight cuts in from the steps above, giving the
           chamber a diffuse light, but in the shadows low lintelled
           doorways to east and south lead into the deeper darkness
           of the Temple.&quot;,
  has  light;
</pre>

<p class="normal">This room has a <code>name</code> property even 
though rooms are not usually referred to by players. The nouns given 
are words which Inform knows &#8220;you don't need to refer to&#8221;, 
and it's a convention of the genre that the designer should signpost 
the game in this way. For the game to talk about something and later
deny all knowledge &#8211; &#8220;I can't see any such thing&#8221; 
&#8211; is not merely rude but harmful to the player's illusion of 
holding a conversation about a real world. Better to parry with:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>examine lintel</tt><br><a id="p117" name="p117"></a>
That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Not all of the Square Chamber's d&eacute;cor is so 
irrelevant:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; &quot;carved inscriptions&quot;
  with name 'carved' 'inscriptions' 'carvings' 'marks' 'markings'
           'symbols' 'moving' 'scuttling' 'crowd' 'of',
       initial
           &quot;Carved inscriptions crowd the walls, floor and ceiling.&quot;,
       description
           &quot;Each time you look at the carvings closely, they seem
           to be still. But you have the uneasy feeling when you
           look away that they're scuttling, moving about. Two
           glyphs are prominent: Arrow and Circle.&quot;,
  has  static pluralname;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The <code>static</code> attribute means that the inscriptions 
can't be taken or moved. As we went out of our way to describe a shaft 
of sunlight, we'll include that as well:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; sunlight &quot;shaft of sunlight&quot;
  with name 'shaft' 'of' 'sunlight' 'sun' 'light' 'beam' 'sunbeam'
           'ray' 'rays' 'sun^s' 'sunlit' 'air' 'motes' 'dust',
       description
           &quot;Motes of dust glimmer in the shaft of sunlit air, so
           that it seems almost solid.&quot;,
  has  scenery;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The <code>^</code> symbol in <code>&quot;sun^s&quot;</code> 
means an apostrophe, so the word is &#8220;sun's&#8221;. This
object has been given the constant name <code>sunlight</code> because 
other parts of the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; source code will need to refer 
to it later on. Being <code>scenery</code> means that the object is 
not only static but also not described by the game unless actually
examined by the player. A perfectionist might add a <code>before</code> 
rule:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
before [;
    Examine, Search: ;
    default: &quot;It's only an insubstantial shaft of sunlight.&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">so that the player can look at or through the sunlight, 
but any other request involving them will be turned down. Note that 
a <code>default</code> rule, if given, means &#8220;any action except 
those already mentioned&#8221;.</p>

<a id="p118" name="p118"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Objects having <code>scenery</code> are assumed to be mentioned in 
the description text of the room, just as the &#8220;shaft of sunlight&#8221; 
is mentioned in that of the Square Chamber. Giving an object <code>concealed</code> 
marks it as something which is present to a player who knows about it, 
but hidden from the casual eye. It will not be cited in lists of objects
present in the room, and &#8220;take all&#8221; will not take it, but 
&#8220;take secret dossier&#8221;, or whatever, will work. (Designers 
seldom need <code>concealed</code>, but the library uses it all the
time, because the player-object is concealed.)</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Some scenery must spread across several rooms. The 
&#8216;Ruins&#8217;, for instance, are misty, and although we <em>could</em> 
design them with a different &#8220;mist&#8221; object in every misty 
location, this would become tiresome. In &#8216;Advent&#8217;, 
for instance, a stream runs through seven locations, while mist which 
(we are told) is &#8220;frequently a sign of a deep pit leading down 
to water&#8221; can be found in ten different caves. Here is a 
better solution:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object low_mist &quot;low mist&quot;
  with name 'low' 'swirling' 'mist',
       description &quot;The mist has an aroma reminiscent of tortilla.&quot;,
       found_in  Square_Chamber  Forest,
       before [;
           Examine, Search: ;
           Smell: &lt;&lt;Examine self&gt;&gt;;
           default: &quot;The mist is too insubstantial.&quot;;
       ],
  has  scenery;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The <code>found_in</code> property gives a list 
of places in which the mist is found: so far, just the Square Chamber 
and the Forest.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
This allows for up to 32 misty locations. If scenery has to be visible 
even more widely than that, or if it has to change with circumstances 
(for instance, if the mist drifts) then it is simpler to give a routine 
instead of a list. This can look at the current location and say whether 
or not the object should be present, as in the following example from 
a game taking place at night:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object Procyon &quot;Procyon&quot;,
  with name 'procyon' 'alpha' 'canis' 'minoris' 'star',
       description &quot;A double-star eleven light years distant.&quot;,
       found_in [;
           return (location ofclass OutsideRoom);
       ],
  has  scenery;
</pre>

<a id="p119" name="p119"></a>
<p class="aside"><code>found_in</code> is only consulted when the player's 
location changes, and works by moving objects around to give the illusion 
that they are in several places at once: thus, if the player walks from 
a dark field to a hilltop, Procyon will be moved ahead to the hilltop
just in advance of the player's move. This illusion is good enough for 
most practical purposes, but sometimes needs a little extra work to maintain, 
for instance if the sky must suddenly cloud over, concealing the stars. 
Since it often happens that an object must be removed from all the 
places in which it would otherwise appear, an attribute called 
<code>absent</code> is provided which overrides <code>found_in</code> 
and declares that the object is found nowhere. Whatever change is made 
to <code>found_in</code>, or in giving or removing <code>absent</code>, 
the Inform library needs also to be notified that changes have taken 
place. For instance, if you need to occult Procyon behind the moon 
for a while, then:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">give Procyon absent; MoveFloatingObjects();</pre>

<p class="aside">The library routine <code>MoveFloatingObjects</code> 
keeps the books straight after a change of state of <code>found_in</code> 
or <code>absent</code>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Whereas Procyon is entirely visual, some scenery 
items may afflict the other four senses. In &#8216;Ruins&#8217;, 
the <code>Forest</code> contains the rule:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
before [;
    Listen: &quot;Howler monkeys, bats, parrots, macaw.&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">Besides which, we have already said that the mist 
smells of tortilla, which means that if the player types &#8220;smell&#8221; 
in a place where the mist is, there should clearly be some reaction. 
For this, a <code>react_before</code> rule attached to the mist is
ideal:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
react_before [;
    Smell: if (noun == nothing) &lt;&lt;Smell self&gt;&gt;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">This is called a &#8220;react&#8221; rule because 
the mist is reacting to the fact that a <code>Smell</code> action is 
taking place nearby. <code>noun</code> is compared with <code>nothing</code> 
to see if the player has indeed just typed &#8220;smell&#8221; and 
not, say, &#8220;smell crocus&#8221;. Thus, when the action 
<code>Smell</code> takes place near the mist, it is converted into 
<code>Smell low_mist</code>, whereas the action <code>Smell 
crocus</code> would be left alone.

<p class="indent">The five senses all have actions in Inform: 
<code>Look</code>, <code>Listen</code>, <code>Smell</code>, 
<code>Taste</code> and <code>Touch</code>. Of these, <code>Look</code> 
never has a noun attached (because <code>Examine</code>,
<code>LookUnder</code> and <code>Search</code> are provided for 
close-up views), <code>Smell</code> and <code>Listen</code> may or 
may not have while <code>Taste</code> and <code>Touch</code> always 
have.</p>

(Cf. &#8216;Spellbreaker&#8217;.) Make an orange cloud descend on 
the player, which can't be seen through or walked out of.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Rooms also react to actions that might occur in them 
and have their own <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> rules. 
Here's one for the Square Chamber:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
before [;
    Insert:
        if (noun == eggsac &amp;&amp; second == sunlight) {
            remove eggsac; move stone_key to self;
            &quot;You drop the eggsac into the glare of the shaft of
            sunlight. It bubbles obscenely, distends and then
            bursts into a hundred tiny insects which run in all
            directions into the darkness. Only spatters of slime
            and a curious yellow-stone key remain on the chamber
            floor.&quot;;
        }
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">(The variables <code>noun</code> and <code>second</code> 
hold the first and second nouns supplied with an action.) As it happens 
this rule could as easily have been part of the definition of the eggsac 
or the sunlight, but <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> rules 
for rooms are invaluable to code up geographical oddities.</p>

<a name="ex7"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans7">EXERCISE 7</a></b></span><br>
Create a room for &#8216;Ruins&#8217; called the Wormcast, which has 
the oddity that anything dropped there ends up back in the Square Chamber.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Sometimes the room may be a different one after the action has taken 
place. The <code>Go</code> action, for instance, is offered to the 
<code>before</code> routine of the room which is being left, and 
the <code>after</code> routine of the room being arrived in. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
after [;
    Go: if (noun == w_obj)
        print &quot;You feel an overwhelming sense of relief.^&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="aside">will print the message when its room is entered from 
the &#8220;west&quot; direction. Note that this routine returns <code>false</code>, 
in the absence of any code telling it to do otherwise, which means 
that the usual game rules resume after the printing of the message.</p>

<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
&#8216;A Scenic View&#8217; by Richard Barnett demonstrates a system 
for providing examinable scenery much more concisely (without defining 
so many objects). &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span><code>found_in</code> 
can allow a single object to represent many different but similar objects 
across a game, and a good example is found in Martin Braun's <tt>&quot;elevator.inf&quot;</tt> 
example game, where every floor of a building has an up-arrow and a 
down-arrow button to summon an elevator.</p>

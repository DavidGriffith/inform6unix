<p class="normal">To recap, the parser goes through a line of grammar 
tokens trying to match each against some text from the player's input. 
Each token that matches must produce one of the following five results:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>a single object;</li>
<li>a &#8220;multiple object&#8221;, that is, a set of objects;</li>
<li>a number;</li>
<li>a &#8220;consultation topic&#8221;, that is, a collection of words 
left unparsed to be looked through later;</li>
<li>no information at all.
</ol>

<p class="normal">Ordinarily, a single line, though it may contain many 
tokens, can produce at most two substantial results ((a) to (d)), 
at most one of which can be multiple 
<a id="p233" name="p233"></a>
(b). (See the exercises below 
if this is a problem.) For instance, suppose the text &#8220;green 
apple on the table&#8221; is parsed against the grammar line:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">* multi 'on' noun -&gt; Insert</pre>

<p class="normal">The <span class="grammartoken"><code>multi</code></span> 
token matches &#8220;green apple&#8221; (result: a single object, since
although <span class="grammartoken"><code>multi</code></span> can match 
a multiple object, it doesn't have to), <span class="grammartoken"><code>'on'</code></span>
matches &#8220;on&#8221; (result: nothing) and the second 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span> token matches 
&#8220;the table&#8221; (result: a single object again). There are two 
substantial results, both objects, so the action that comes out is 
<code>&lt;Insert apple table&gt;</code>. If the text had been &#8220;all 
the fruit on the table&#8221;, the <span class="grammartoken"><code>multi</code></span> 
token might have resulted in a list: perhaps of an apple, an orange 
and a pear. The parser would then have generated and run through three 
actions in turn: <code>&lt;Insert apple table&gt;</code>, then
<code>&lt;Insert orange table&gt;</code> and finally 
<code>&lt;Insert pear table&gt;</code>, printing out the name of each 
item and a colon before running the action:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>put all the fruit on the table</tt><br>
Cox's pippin: Done.<br>
orange: Done.<br>
Conference pear: Done.</p>

<p class="normal">The library's routine <code>InsertSub</code>, which 
actually handles the action, only deals with single objects at a time, 
and in each case it printed &#8220;Done.&#8221;</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>'</code>&#8249;<span class="token">word</span>&#8250;<code>'</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This matches only the literal word given, sometimes called 
a preposition because it usually is one, and produces no resulting 
information. (There can therefore be as many or as few of them on a 
grammar line as desired.) It often happens that several prepositions really 
mean the same thing for a given verb: for instance &#8220;in&#8221;, 
&#8220;into&#8221; and &#8220;inside&#8221; are often synonymous.
As a convenient shorthand, then, you can write a series of prepositions 
(only) with slashes <code>/</code> in between, to mean &#8220;one of 
these words&#8221;. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">* noun 'in'/'into'/'inside' noun -&gt; Insert</pre>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches any single object &#8220;in scope&#8221;, a 
term defined in the next section and which roughly means &#8220;visible 
to the player at the moment&#8221;.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>held</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches any single object which is an immediate possession 
of the actor. (Thus, if a key is inside a box being carried by the actor, 
the box might match but the key cannot.) This is convenient for two reasons. Firstly, 
<a id="p234" name="p234"></a>
many actions, such as <code>Eat</code> or <code>Wear</code>, 
only sensibly apply to things being held. Secondly, suppose we have grammar</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'eat' * held -&gt; Eat;</pre>

<p class="normal">and the player types &#8220;eat the banana&#8221; while 
the banana is, say, in plain view on a shelf. It would be petty of the 
game to refuse on the grounds that the banana is not being held. 
So the parser will generate a <code>Take</code> action for the banana 
and then, if the <code>Take</code> action succeeds, an <code>Eat</code>
action. Notice that the parser does not just pick up the object, but 
issues an action in the proper way &#8211; so if the banana had rules 
making it too slippery to pick up, it won't be picked up. This is 
called &#8220;implicit taking&#8221;, and happens only for the player, 
not for other actors.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>multi</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches one or more objects in scope. The 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>multi-</code></span> tokens indicate 
that a list of one or more objects can go here. The parser works out
all the things the player has asked for, sorting out plural nouns and 
words like &#8220;except&#8221; in the process. For instance, &#8220;all 
the apples&#8221; and &#8220;the duck and the drake&#8221; could match 
a <span class="grammartoken"><code>multi</code></span> token but not 
a <span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span> token.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>multiexcept</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches one or more objects in scope, except that it does
not match the other single object parsed in the same grammar line. This 
is provided to make commands like &#8220;put everything in the rucksack&#8221; 
come out right: the &#8220;everything&#8221; is matched by all of the 
player's possessions except the rucksack, which stops the parser from 
generating an action to put the rucksack inside itself.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>multiinside</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, this matches anything inside the other single
object parsed on the same grammar line, which is good for parsing 
commands like &#8220;remove everything from the cupboard&#8221;.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken">&#8249;<span class="token">attribute</span>&#8250;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches any object in scope which has the given attribute.
This is useful for sorting out actions according to context, and perhaps 
the ultimate example might be an old-fashioned &#8220;use&#8221; verb:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Verb 'use' 'employ' 'utilise'
    * edible    -&gt; Eat
    * clothing  -&gt; Wear
    ...
    * enterable -&gt; Enter;
</pre>

<a id="p235" name="p235"></a>
<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>creature</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches any object in scope which behaves as if living. 
This normally means having <code>animate</code>: but, as an exceptional 
rule, if the action on the grammar line is <code>Ask</code>, 
<code>Answer</code>, <code>Tell</code> or <code>AskFor</code> then 
having <code>talkable</code> is also acceptable.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>noun = </code>&#8249;<span class="token">Routine</span>&#8250;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Any single object in scope satisfying some condition&#8221;. 
When determining whether an object passes this test, the parser sets the 
variable <code>noun</code> to the object in question and calls the routine. 
If it returns <code>true</code>, the parser accepts the object, and 
otherwise it rejects it. For example, the following should only apply 
to animals kept in a cage:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ CagedCreature;
  if (noun in wicker_cage) rtrue; rfalse;
];
Verb 'free' 'release'
     * noun=CagedCreature -&gt; FreeAnimal;
</pre>

<p class="normal">So that only nouns which pass the <code>CagedCreature</code> 
test are allowed. The <code>CagedCreature</code> routine can appear anywhere 
in the source code, though it's tidier to keep it nearby.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>scope = </code>&#8249;<span class="token">Routine</span>&#8250;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An even more powerful token, which means &#8220;an object 
in scope&#8221; where scope is redefined specially. You can also choose
whether or not it can accept a multiple object. See <a href="s32.html">&#167;32</a>.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>number</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matches any decimal number from 0 upwards (though it rounds
off large numbers to 10,000), and also matches the numbers &#8220;one&#8221; 
to &#8220;twenty&#8221; written in English. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'type' * number -&gt; TypeNum;</pre>

<p class="normal">causes actions like <code>&lt;Typenum 504&gt;</code> when 
the player types &#8220;type 504&#8221;. Note that <code>noun</code> is 
set to 504, not to an object. (While <code>inp1</code> is set to 1, 
indicating that this &#8220;first input&#8221; is intended as a number: 
if the noun had been the object which happened to have number 504, 
then <code>inp1</code> would have been set to this object, the same 
as <code>noun</code>.) If you need more exact number parsing, without
rounding off, and including negative numbers, see the exercise below.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans83">EXERCISE 83</a></b></span><br>
Some games, such as David M. Baggett's game &#8216;The Legend Lives!&#8217; 
produce footnotes every now and then. Arrange matters so that these 
are numbered <code>[1]</code>, <code>[2]</code> and so on in order 
of appearance, to be read by the player when &#8220;footnote 1&#8221; 
is typed.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The entry point <code>ParseNumber</code> allows you to provide your 
own number-parsing routine, which opens up many sneaky possibilities &#8211; 
Roman numerals, coordinates like &#8220;J4&#8221;, very long telephone 
numbers and so on. This takes the form</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ ParseNumber buffer length;
  ...returning false if no match is made, or the number otherwise...
];
</pre>

<p class="aside">and examines the supposed &#8216;number&#8217; held 
at the byte address <code>buffer</code>, a row of characters of the 
given length. If you provide a <code>ParseNumber</code> routine but 
return <code>false</code> from it, then the parser falls back on 
its usual number-parsing mechanism to see if that does any better.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Note that <code>ParseNumber</code> can't return 0 to mean the number 
zero, because 0 is the same as <code>false</code>. Probably 
&#8220;zero&#8221; won't be needed too often, but if it is you can always
return some value like 1000 and code the verb in question to understand 
this as 0. (Sorry: this was a poor design decision made too long ago 
to change now.)</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken"><code>topic</code></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This token matches as much text as possible, regardless 
of what it says, producing no result. As much text as possible means 
&#8220;until the end of the typing, or, if the next token is a 
preposition, until that preposition is reached&#8221;. The only way 
this can fail is if it finds no text at all. Otherwise, the variable
<code>consult_from</code> is set to the number of the first word of the 
matched text and <code>consult_words</code> to the number of words. 
See <a href="s16.html">&#167;16</a> and <a href="s18.html">&#167;18</a> 
for examples of topics being used.</p>

<p class="tokendef"><span class="grammartoken">&#8249;<span class="token">Routine</span>&#8250;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The most flexible token is simply the name of a &#8220;general
parsing routine&#8221;. As the name suggests, it is a routine to do some 
parsing which can have any outcome you choose, and many of the interesting 
things you can do with the parser involve writing one. A general parsing 
routine looks at the word stream using <code>NextWord</code> and 
<code>wn</code> (see <a href="s28.html">&#167;28</a>) to make its decisions, 
and should return one of the following. Note that the values beginning 
<code>GPR_</code> are constants defined by the library.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td><code>GPR_FAIL</code></td><td>if there is no match;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GPR_MULTIPLE</code></td><td>if the result is a multiple object;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GPR_NUMBER</code></td><td>if the result is a number;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GPR_PREPOSITION</code></td><td>if there is a match but no result;</td></tr>
<tr><td><a id="p237" name="p237"></a><code>GPR_REPARSE</code></td><td>to reparse the whole command from scratch; or</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>O</i></td><td>if the result is a single object <i>O</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">On an unsuccessful match, returning <code>GPR_FAIL</code>, 
it doesn't matter what the final value of <code>wn</code> is. On a 
successful match it should be left pointing to the next thing <em>after</em> 
what the routine understood. Since <code>NextWord</code> moves <code>wn</code> 
on by one each time it is called, this happens automatically unless 
the routine has read too far. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ OnAtorIn;
  if (NextWord() == 'on' or 'at' or 'in') return GPR_PREPOSITION;
  return GPR_FAIL;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">duplicates the effect of 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>'on'/'at'/'in'</code></span>, 
that is, it makes a token which accepts any of the words &#8220;on&quot;, 
&#8220;at&quot; or &#8220;in&quot; as prepositions. Similarly,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ Anything;
  while (NextWordStopped() ~= -1) ; return GPR_PREPOSITION;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">accepts the entire rest of the line (even an empty 
text, if there are no more words on the line), ignoring it. 
<code>NextWordStopped</code> is a form of <code>NextWord</code> which
returns the special value &#8722;1 once the original word stream has 
run out.</p>

<p class="indent">If you return <code>GPR_NUMBER</code>, the number 
which you want to be the result should be put into the library's 
variable <code>parsed_number</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">If you return <code>GPR_MULTIPLE</code>, place your 
chosen objects in the table <code>multiple_object</code>: that is, 
place the number of objects in <code>multiple_object--&gt;0</code> 
and the objects themselves in <code>--&gt;1</code>, &#8230;</p>

<p class="indent">The value <code>GPR_REPARSE</code> should only be 
returned if you have actually altered the text you were supposed to be 
parsing. This is a feature used internally by the parser when it asks 
&#8220;Which do you mean&#8230;?&#8221; questions, and you can use 
it too, but be wary of loops in which the parser eternally changes
and reparses the same text.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
To parse a token, the parser uses a routine called <code>ParseToken</code>. 
This behaves almost exactly like a general parsing routine, and returns 
the same range of values. For instance,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">ParseToken(ELEMENTARY_TT, NUMBER_TOKEN)</pre>

<a id="p238" name="p238"></a>
<p class="aside">parses exactly as <span class="grammartoken"><code>number</code></span> 
does: similarly for <code>NOUN_TOKEN</code>, <code>HELD_TOKEN</code>, 
<code>MULTI_TOKEN</code>, <code>MULTIHELD_TOKEN</code>, 
<code>MULTIEXCEPT_TOKEN</code>, <code>MULTIINSIDE_TOKEN</code> and 
<code>CREATURE_TOKEN</code>. The call</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">ParseToken(SCOPE_TT, MyRoutine)</pre>

<p class="aside">does what <span class="grammartoken"><code>scope=MyRoutine</code></span> 
does. In fact <code>ParseToken</code> can parse any kind of token,
but these are the only cases which are both useful enough to mention 
and safe enough to use. It means you can conveniently write a token 
which matches, say, <em>either</em> the word &#8220;kit&#8221; <em>or</em> 
any named set of items in scope:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ KitOrStuff; if (NextWord() == 'kit') return GPR_PREPOSITION;
  wn--; return ParseToken(ELEMENTARY_TT, MULTI_TOKEN);
];

Now add the ability to match character constants like <code>'7'</code>, 
producing the correct character value (in this case 55, the ZSCII 
value for the character &#8216;7&#8217;).</p>

Next add the ability to match the names of attributes, such as 
<code>edible</code>, or negated attributes with a tilde in front, 
such as <code>~edible</code>. An ordinary attribute should parse 
to its number, a negated one should parse to its number plus 100. 
(Hint: the library has a printing rule called <code>DebugAttribute</code> 
which prints the name of an attribute.)</p>

<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
Once upon a time, Andrew Clover wrote a neat library extension called 
<tt>&quot;timewait.h&quot;</tt> for parsing times of day, and allowing 
commands such as &#8220;wait until quarter to three&#8221;. L. Ross 
Raszewski, Nicholas Daley and Kevin Forchione each tinkered with and
modernised this, so that there are now also <tt>&quot;waittime.h&quot;</tt> 
and <tt>&quot;timesys.h&quot;</tt>. Each has its merits.</p>

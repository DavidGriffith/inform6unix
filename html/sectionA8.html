The actions implemented by the library are in three groups.  Group 1 consists
of actions associated with 'meta'-verbs, which are not subject to game
rules.  (If you want a room where the
game can't be saved, as for instance 'Spellbreaker' cunningly does, you'll
have to tamper with <TT>SaveSub</TT> directly, using a <TT>Replace</TT>d routine.)
<PRE>
1a. Quit, Restart, Restore, Verify, Save, ScriptOn, ScriptOff, Pronouns,
    Score, Fullscore, LMode1, LMode2, LMode3, NotifyOn, NotifyOff,
    Version, Places, Objects.
</PRE>


(<TT>Lmode1</TT>, <TT>Lmode2</TT> and <TT>Lmode3</TT> switch between "brief'', "verbose''
and "superbrief'' room description styles.)
In addition, but only if <TT>DEBUG</TT> is defined, so that the debugging suite
is present, group 1 contains
<PRE>
1b. TraceOn, TraceOff, TraceLevel, ActionsOn, ActionsOff, RoutinesOn,
    RoutinesOff, TimersOn, TimersOff, CommandsOn, CommandsOff, CommandsRead,
    Predictable, XPurloin, XAbstract, XTree, Scope, Goto, Gonear.
</PRE>

Group 2 contains actions which sometimes get as far as the 'after' stage,
because the library sometimes does something when processing them.
<PRE>
2. Inv, InvTall, InvWide, Take, Drop, Remove, PutOn, Insert, Transfer,
   Empty, Enter, Exit, GetOff, Go, GoIn, Look, Examine, Search, Give, Show,
   Unlock, Lock, SwitchOn, SwitchOff, Open, Close, Disrobe, Wear, Eat.
</PRE>

Group 3 contains the remaining actions, which never reach 'after' because
the library simply prints a message and stops at the 'during' stage.
<PRE>
3. Yes, No, Burn, Pray, Wake, WakeOther [person], Consult,
   Kiss, Think, Smell, Listen, Taste, Touch, Dig,
   Cut, Jump [jump on the spot], JumpOver, Tie, Drink,
   Fill, Sorry, Strong [swear word], Mild [swear word], Attack, Swim,
   Swing [something], Blow, Rub, Set, SetTo, WaveHands [ie, just "wave"],
   Wave [something], Pull, Push, PushDir [push something in a direction],
   Turn, Squeeze, LookUnder [look underneath something],
   ThrowAt, Answer, Buy, Ask, AskFor, Sing, Climb, Wait, Sleep.
</PRE>

The library also defines 8 fake actions:
<PRE>
LetGo, Receive, ThrownAt, Order, TheSame, PluralFound, Miscellany, Prompt
</PRE>
<TR><TD><TD bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><SMALL>
<TT>LetGo</TT>, <TT>Receive</TT> and <TT>ThrownAt</TT> are used to allow the <TT>second</TT>
noun of <TT>Insert</TT>, <TT>PutOn</TT>, <TT>ThrowAt</TT>, <TT>Remove</TT> actions to intervene;
<TT>Order</TT> is used to process actions through somebody's <TT>life</TT> routine;
<TT>TheSame</TT> and <TT>PluralFound</TT> are defined by the parser as ways for the
program to communicate with it; <TT>Miscellany</TT> and <TT>Prompt</TT> are defined
as slots for <TT>LibraryMessages</TT>.

<h2>&#167;44 &nbsp; Case study: a library file for menus</h2>

<blockquote>Yes, all right, I won't do the menu &#8230; I don't think 
you realise how long it takes to do the menu, but no, it doesn't matter, 
I'll hang the picture now. If the menus are late for lunch it doesn't 
matter, the guests can all come and look at the picture till they 
are ready, right?<br>
&#8212; John Cleese and Connie Booth, <i>Fawlty Towers</i></blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-336_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Sometimes one would like to provide a menu of text options, offered
to the player as a list on screen which can be rummaged through
with the cursor keys. For instance, the hints display in the &#8220;solid
gold&#8221; edition of Infocom's &#8216;Zork I&#8217; shows a list of 
&#8220;Invisiclues&#8221;: &#8220;Above Ground&#8221;, &#8220;The Cellar 
Area&#8221;, and so on. Moving a cursor to one of these options 
and pressing RETURN brings up a sub-menu of questions on the general 
topic chosen: for instance, &#8220;How do I cross the mountains?&#8221; 
Besides hints, many modern games use menu displays for instructions, 
background information, credits and release notes.</p>

<p class="indent">An optional library file called <tt>&quot;Menus.h&quot;</tt> 
is provided to manage such menus. If you want its facilities then, where 
you previously included <code>Verblib</code>, now write:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Include &quot;Verblib&quot;;
Include &quot;Menus&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">And this will make the features of <tt>Menus.h</tt> available. 
This section describes what these simple features are, and how they work, 
as an extended example of Z-machine programming.</p>

<p class="indent">The designer of this system began by noticing that 
menus and submenus and options fit together in a tree structure rather 
like the object tree:</p>

<p class="output">Hints for &#8216;Zork I&#8217; (menu)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &rarr; Above Ground (submenu)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &rarr; How do I cross the mountains? (option)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &rarr; <i>some text is revealed</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &rarr; The Cellar Area (submenu)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &rarr; ...</p>

<a id="p337" name="p337"></a>
<p class="normal">The library file therefore defines two classes of object, 
<code>Menu</code> and <code>Option</code>. The short name of a menu is 
its title, while its children are the possible choices, which can be of 
either class. (So you can have as many levels of submenu as needed.) 
Since choosing an <code>Option</code> is supposed to produce some text, 
which is vaguely like examining objects, the <code>description</code> property of 
an <code>Option</code> holds the information revealed. So, for instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Menu hints_menu &quot;Hints for Zork I&quot;;
Menu -&gt; &quot;Above Ground&quot;;
Option -&gt; -&gt; &quot;How do I cross the mountains?&quot;
  with description &quot;By ...&quot;;
Menu -&gt; &quot;The Cellar Area&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Note that such a structure can be rearranged in play 
just as the rest of the object tree can, which is convenient for &#8220;adaptive 
hints&#8221;, where the hints offered vary with the player's present travail.</p>

<p class="indent">How does this work? A menu or an option is chosen by 
being sent the message <code>select</code>. So the designer will launch 
the menu, perhaps in response to the player having typed &#8220;hints&#8221;, 
like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ HintsSub;
  hints_menu.select();
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">As the player browses through the menu, each menu sends 
the <code>select</code> message to the next one chosen, and so on. This already suggests 
that menus and options are basically similar, and in fact that's right: 
<code>Menu</code> is actually a subclass of <code>Option</code>, which 
is the more basic idea of the two.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The actual code of <tt>Menus.h</tt> is slightly different 
from that given below, but only to fuss with dealing with early copies 
of the rest of the library, and to handle multiple languages. It begins 
with the class definition of <code>Option</code>, as follows:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class Option
 with select [;
          self.emblazon(1, 1, 1);
          @set_window 0; font on; style roman; new_line; new_line;
          if (self provides description) return self.description();
          &quot;[No text written for this option.]^&quot;;
      ],
</pre>

<a id="p338" name="p338"></a>
<p class="normal">The option sends itself the message <code>emblazon(1,1,1)</code> 
to clear the screen an put a bar of height 1 line at the top, containing 
the title of the option centred. The other two 1s declare that this 
is &#8220;page 1 of 1&#8221;: see below. Window 0 (the ordinary, lower 
window) is then selected; text reverts to its usual state of being
roman-style and using a variable-pitched font. The screen is now empty 
and ready for use, and the option expects to have a <code>description</code> 
property which actually does any printing that's required. To get back 
to the emblazoning:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
emblazon [ bar_height page pages temp;
    screen_width = 0-&gt;33;
    !   Clear screen:
    @erase_window -1;
    @split_window bar_height;
    !   Black out top line in reverse video:
    @set_window 1;
    @set_cursor 1 1;
    style reverse; spaces(screen_width);
    if (standard_interpreter == 0)
        @set_cursor 1 1;
    else {
        ForUseByOptions--&gt;0 = 128;
        @output_stream 3 ForUseByOptions;
        print (name) self;
        if (pages ~= 1) print &quot; [&quot;, page, &quot;/&quot;, pages, &quot;]&quot;;
        @output_stream -3;
        temp = (screen_width - ForUseByOptions--&gt;0)/2;
        @set_cursor 1 temp;
    }
    print (name) self;
    if (pages ~= 1) print &quot; [&quot;, page, &quot;/&quot;, pages, &quot;]&quot;;
    return ForUseByOptions--&gt;0;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">That completes <code>Option</code>. However, since 
this code refers to a variable and an array, we had better write 
definitions of them:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Global screen_width;
Global screen_height;
Array ForUseByOptions -&gt; 129;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(The other global variable, <code>screen_height</code>, 
will be used later. The variables are global because they will be needed 
by all of the menu objects.) The <code>emblazon</code> code checks 
to see if it's running on a standard interpreter. If so, it uses output 
stream 3 into an array to measure the length of text like &#8220;The
<a id="p339" name="p339"></a>
Cellars [2/3]&#8221; in order to centre it on the top line. If not, 
the text appears at the top left instead.</p>

<p class="indent">So much for <code>Option</code>. The definition of 
<code>Menu</code> is, inevitably, longer. It inherits <code>emblazon</code> 
from its superclass <code>Option</code>, but overrides the definition 
of <code>select</code> with something more elaborate:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class Menu class Option
 with select [ count j obj pkey line oldline top_line bottom_line
        page pages options top_option;
          screen_width = 0-&gt;33;
          screen_height = 0-&gt;32;
          if (screen_height == 0 or 255) screen_height = 18;
          screen_height = screen_height - 7;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The first task is to work out how much room the screen 
has to display options. The width and height, in characters, are read 
out of the story file's header area, where the interpreter has written 
them. In case the interpreter is <em>really</em> poor, we guess at 18 
if the height is claimed to be zero or 255; since this is a library 
file and will be widely used, it errs on the side of extreme caution.
Finally, 7 is subtracted because seven of the screen lines are occupied 
by the panel at the top and white space above and below the choices. 
The upshot is that <code>screen_height</code> is the actual maximum number 
of options to be offered per page of the menu. Next: how many options are 
available?</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          options = 0;
          objectloop (obj in self &amp;&amp; obj ofclass Option) options++;
          if (options == 0) return 2;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(Note that a <code>Menu</code> is also an <code>Option</code>.) 
We can now work out how many pages will be needed.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          pages = options/screen_height;
          if (options%screen_height ~= 0) pages++;
          top_line = 6;
          page = 1;
          line = top_line;
</pre>

<p class="normal"><code>top_line</code> is the highest screen line used 
to display an option: line 6. The local variables <code>page</code> and 
<code>line</code> show which line on which page the current selection
arrow points to, so we're starting at the top line of page 1.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          .ReDisplay;
          top_option = (page - 1) * screen_height;
</pre>

<a id="p340" name="p340"></a>
<p class="normal">This is the option number currently selected, counting 
from zero. We display the three-line black strip at the top of the 
screen, using <code>emblazon</code> to create the upper window:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          self.emblazon(7 + count, page, pages);
          @set_cursor 2 1; spaces(screen_width);
          @set_cursor 2 2; print &quot;N = next subject&quot;;
          j = screen_width-12; @set_cursor 2 j; print &quot;P = previous&quot;;
          @set_cursor 3 1; spaces(screen_width);
          @set_cursor 3 2; print &quot;RETURN = read subject&quot;;
          j = screen_width-17; @set_cursor 3 j;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The last part of the black strip to print is the 
one offering Q to quit:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          if (sender ofclass Option) print &quot;Q = previous menu&quot;;
          else print &quot;  Q = resume game&quot;;
          style roman;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The point of this is that pressing Q only takes us 
back to the previous menu if we're inside the hierarchy, i.e., if the 
message <code>select</code> was sent to this <code>Menu</code> by another 
<code>Option</code>; whereas if not, Q takes us out of the menu altogether. 
Next, we count through those options appearing on the current page 
and print their names.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          count = top_line; j = 0;
          objectloop (obj in self &amp;&amp; obj ofclass Option) {
              if (j &gt;= top_option &amp;&amp; j &lt; (top_option+screen_height)) {
                  @set_cursor count 6;
                  print (name) obj;
                  count++;
              }
              j++;
          }
          bottom_line = count - 1;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Note that the name of the option begins on column 6 
of each line. The player's current selection is shown with a cursor 
<code>&gt;</code> appearing in column 4:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          oldline = 0;
          for (::) {
              ! Move or create the &gt; cursor:
              if (line ~= oldline) {
                  if (oldline ~= 0) {
                      @set_cursor oldline 4; print &quot; &quot;;
                  }
                  @set_cursor line 4; print &quot;&gt;&quot;;<a id="p341" name="p341"></a>
              }
              oldline = line;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Now we wait for a single key-press from the player:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
              @read_char 1 -&gt; pkey;
              if (pkey == 'N' or 'n' or 130) {
                  ! Cursor down:
                  line++;
                  if (line &gt; bottom_line) {
                      line = top_line;
                      if (pages &gt; 1) {
                          if (page == pages) page = 1; else page++;
                          jump ReDisplay;
                      }
                  }
                  continue;
              }
</pre>

<p class="normal">130 is the ZSCII code for &#8220;cursor down key&#8221;. 
Note that if the player tries to move the cursor off the bottom of the 
list, and there's at least one more page, we jump right out of the loop 
and back to <code>ReDisplay</code> to start again from the top of the 
next page. Handling the &#8220;previous&#8221; option is very similar, 
and then:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
              if (pkey == 'Q' or 'q' or 27 or 131) break;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Thus pressing lower or upper case Q, escape (ZSCII 27) 
or cursor left (ZSCII 131) all have the same effect: to break out of 
the for loop. Otherwise, one can press RETURN or cursor right to select 
an option:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
              if (pkey == 10 or 13 or 132) {
                  count = 0;
                  objectloop (obj in self &amp;&amp; obj ofclass Option) {
                      if (count == top_option + line - top_line) break;
                      count++;
                  }
                  switch (obj.select()) {
                      2: jump ReDisplay;
                      3: jump ExitMenu;
                  }
                  print &quot;[Please press SPACE to continue.]^&quot;;
                  @read_char 1 -&gt; pkey;
                  jump ReDisplay;
              }
          }
</pre>

<a id="p342" name="p342"></a>
<p class="normal">(No modern interpreter should ever give 10 for the 
key-code of RETURN, which is ZSCII 13. Once again, the library file 
is erring on the side of extreme caution.) An option's <code>select</code> 
routine can return three different values for different effects:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="clump"><table border="1" align="center" style="text-align:center">
<tr><td>2</td><td>Redisplay the menu page that selected me</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Exit from that menu page</td></tr>
<tr><td>anything else</td><td>Wait for SPACE, then redisplay that menu page</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">Finally, the exit from the menu, either because the 
player typed Q, escape, etc., or because the selected option returned 3:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
          .ExitMenu;
          if (sender ofclass Option) return 2;
          font on; @set_cursor 1 1;
          @erase_window -1; @set_window 0;
          new_line; new_line; new_line;
          if (deadflag == 0) &lt;&lt;Look&gt;&gt;;
          return 2;
      ];
</pre>

<p class="normal">And that's it. If this menu was the highest-level one, it 
needs to resume the game politely, by clearing the screen and performing 
a <code>Look</code> action. If not, then it needs only to return 2, 
indicating &#8220;redisplay the menu page that selected me&#8221;: 
that is, the menu one level above.</p>

<p class="indent">The only remaining code in <tt>&quot;Menus.h&quot;</tt> 
shows some of the flexibility of the above design, by defining a special 
type of option:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class SwitchOption class Option
  with short_name [;
           print (object) self, &quot; &quot;;
           if (self has on) print &quot;(on)&quot;; else print &quot;(off)&quot;;
           rtrue;
       ],
       select [;
           if (self has on) give self ~on; else give self on;
           return 2;
       ];
</pre>

<p class="normal">Here is an example of <code>SwitchOptions</code> in 
use:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Menu settings &quot;Game settings&quot;;
SwitchOption -&gt; FullRoomD   &quot;full room descriptions&quot; has on;
SwitchOption -&gt; WordyP      &quot;wordier prompts&quot;;
SwitchOption -&gt; AllowSavedG &quot;allow saved games&quot; has on;
</pre>

<a id="p343" name="p343"></a>
<p class="normal">So each option has the attribute <code>on</code> only if 
currently set. In the menu, the option <code>FullRoomD</code> is displayed 
either as &#8220;full room descriptions (on)&#8221; or &#8220;full room 
descriptions (off)&#8221;, and selecting it switches the state, like a 
light switch. The rest of the code can then perform tests like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
if (AllowSavedG hasnt on) &quot;That spell is forbidden.&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>

Because there was a crying need for good menus in the early days of 
Inform, there are now numerous library extensions to support menus 
and interfaces built from them. The original such was L. Ross Raszewski's 
<tt>&quot;domenu.h&quot;</tt>, which provides a core of basic routines. 
<tt>&quot;AltMenu.h&quot;</tt> then uses these routines to emulate the 
same menu structures coded up in this section. <tt>&quot;Hints.h&quot;</tt> 
employs them for Invisiclues-style hints; <tt>&quot;manual.h&quot;</tt> 
for browsing books and manuals; <tt>&quot;converse.h&quot;</tt> for 
menu-based conversations with people, similar to those in graphical 
adventure games. Or indeed to those in Adam Cadre's game &#8216;Photopia&#8217;, 
and Adam has kindly extracted his menu-based conversational routines 
into an example program called <tt>&quot;phototalk.inf&quot;</tt>.
For branching menus, such as a tree of questions and answers, try 
Chris Klimas's <tt>&quot;branch.h&quot;</tt>. To put a menu of commands 
at the status line of a typical game, try Adam Stark's <tt>&quot;action.h&quot;</tt>.</p>

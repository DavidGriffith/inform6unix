<h2>&#167;12 &nbsp; Containers, supporters and sub-objects</h2>

<blockquote>The year has been a good one for the Society
<i>(hear, hear)</i>. This year our members have put more things 
on top of other things than ever before. But, I should warn you, 
this is no time for complacency. No, there are still many things, 
and I cannot emphasize this too strongly, <em>not</em> on top of other 
things.<br>&#8212; &#8216;The Royal Society For Putting Things 
On Top Of Other Things&#8217; sketch, <i>Monty Python's Flying 
Circus</i>, programme 18 (1970)</blockquote>

In almost every game, certain objects need to be thought of as on
top of or inside other objects. The library provides actions <code>Insert</code>
and <code>PutOn</code> for placing things inside or on top of something, 
and <code>Remove</code> for taking things out of or off the top of something. 
Many objects, such as house-bricks, cannot sensibly contain things, 
and a designer usually only wants certain specific items ever to have 
other things on top of them. In the model world, then, only objects which 
the designer has given the <code>container</code> attribute can contain 
things, and only those given the <code>supporter</code> attribute 
can have items on top.</p>

<p class="indent">The packing case brought by our archaeologist hero 
to the scene of the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; (found in the opening location, 
the Forest) is a thoroughly typical <code>container</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; packing_case &quot;packing case&quot;
  with name 'packing' 'case' 'box' 'strongbox',
       initial
           &quot;Your packing case rests here, ready to hold any important
           cultural finds you might make, for shipping back to
           civilisation.&quot;,
       before [;
           Take, Remove, PushDir:
               &quot;The case is too heavy to bother moving, as long as
               your expedition is still incomplete.&quot;;
       ],
  has  static container open openable;
</pre>

<p class="normal">A container can hold anything up to 100 items, but 
this limit can be modified by giving the container a <code>capacity</code> 
property.</p>

<p class="indent">Note that the packing case is defined having an 
attribute called <code>open</code>. This is essential, because the 
library will only allow the player to put things in a <code>container</code> 
if it is currently <code>open</code>. (There is no attribute called 
<code>closed</code>, as any 
<a id="p129" name="p129"></a>
container lacking <code>open</code> is 
considered closed.) If a container has <code>openable</code>, the
player can open and close it at will, unless it also has <code>locked</code>. 
A <code>locked</code> object, whether it be a door or a container, 
cannot be opened. But if it has <code>lockable</code> then it can 
be locked or unlocked with the key object given in its <code>with_key</code>
property. If <code>with_key</code> is undeclared or equal to <code>nothing</code>, 
then no key will fit, but this will not be told to the player. The 
actions <code>Open</code>, <code>Close</code>, <code>Lock</code> and
<code>Unlock</code> handle all of this.</p>

<p class="normal">An object having <code>supporter</code> can have 
up to 100 items put on top of it, or, once again, its <code>capacity</code> 
value if one is given. An object cannot be both a <code>container</code> 
and a <code>supporter</code> at once, and there's no concept of 
being &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;locked&#8221; for supporters. 
Here is an example from the Shrine:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; stone_table &quot;slab altar&quot;
  with name 'stone' 'table' 'slab' 'altar' 'great',
       initial &quot;A great stone slab of a table, or altar, dominates
           the Shrine.&quot;,
  has  enterable supporter static;
</pre>

<p class="normal">See <a href="s15.html">&#167;15</a> for <code>enterable</code> 
and its consequences.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Containers and supporters are able to react to 
things being put inside them, or removed from them, by acting on the 
signal to <code>Receive</code> or <code>LetGo</code>. For example, 
further down in the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; is a chasm which, perhaps 
surprisingly, is implemented as a container:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; chasm &quot;horrifying chasm&quot;
  with name 'blackness' 'chasm' 'pit' 'horrifying' 'bottomless',
       react_before [;
           Jump: &lt;&lt;Enter self&gt;&gt;;
           Go: if (noun == d_obj) &lt;&lt;Enter self&gt;&gt;;
       ],
       before [;
           Enter: deadflag = true;
               &quot;You plummet through the silent void of darkness!&quot;;
           JumpOver: &quot;It's far too wide.&quot;;
       ],
       after [;
           Receive: remove noun;<a id="p130" name="p130"></a>
               print_ret (The) noun, &quot; tumbles silently into the
                   darkness of the chasm.&quot;;
           Search: &quot;The chasm is deep and murky.&quot;;
       ],
  has  scenery open container;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(Actually the definition will grow in 
<a href="s23.html">&#167;23</a>, so that the chasm reacts to an 
eight-foot pumice-stone ball being rolled into it.) Note the use of 
an <code>after</code> rule for the <code>Search</code> action: 
this is because an attempt to &#8220;examine&#8221; or &#8220;look 
inside&#8221; the chasm will cause this action. <code>Search</code> 
means, in effect, &#8220;tell me what is inside the container&#8221; 
and the <code>after</code> rule prevents a message like &#8220;There 
is nothing inside the chasm.&#8221; from misleading the player. 
Note also that the chasm &#8216;steals&#8217; any stray <code>Jump</code> 
action in the vicinity using <code>react_before</code> and
converts it into an early death.</p>

<b><a href="sa6.html#ans16">EXERCISE 16</a></b></span><br>
Make an acquisitive bag which will swallow things up but refuses to

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
<code>Receive</code> is sent to an object <i>O</i> when a player 
tries to put something in <i>O</i>, or on <i>O</i>. In the rare event 
that <i>O</i> needs to react differently to these two attempts, 
it may consult the library's variable <code>receive_action</code> 
to find out whether <code>##PutOn</code> or <code>##Insert</code> 
is the cause.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Not all containment is about carrying or supporting 
things. For instance, suppose a machine has four levers. If the 
machine is fixed in place somewhere, like a printing press, the 
levers could be provided as four further <code>static</code> objects. 
But if it is portable, like a sewing machine, we need to make sure
that the levers always move whenever it moves, and vice versa. 
The natural solution is to make the lever-objects children of the 
machine-object, as though the machine were a container and the 
levers were its contents.</p>

<p class="indent">However, members of an object which isn't a <code>container</code> 
or <code>supporter</code> are normally assumed by the library to be 
hidden invisibly inside. In the case of the levers, this would defeat 
the point. We can get around this by giving the machine the <code>transparent</code> 
attribute, making the levers visible but not removable.</p>

<p class="indent">Containers can also be <code>transparent</code>, making 
their contents visible even when closed. The items on top of a <code>supporter</code> 
are of course always visible, and it makes no sense for a <code>supporter</code> 
to be <code>transparent</code>. See <a href="s26.html">&#167;26</a> 
for further details on when contents are listed in inventories and 
room descriptions.</p>

Implement a macram&eacute; bag hanging from the ceiling, inside 
which objects are visible, audible and so forth, but cannot be

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The most difficult case to handle is when an object needs to be 
portable, <em>and</em> to have sub-objects like lamps and buttons, and 
also to be a container in its own right. The solution to this will 
have to be left until the &#8220;scope addition&#8221; rules in 
<a href="s32.html">&#167;32</a>, but briefly: an object's 
<code>add_to_scope</code> property may contain a list of sub-objects 
to be kept attached to it but which are not its children.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
Containers and supporters abound in the example games (except 
&#8216;Advent&#8217;, which is too simple, though see the water-and-oil 
carrying bottle). Interesting containers include the lottery-board 
and the podium sockets from &#8216;Balances&#8217; and the
&#8216;Adventureland&#8217; bottle. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>For supporters, the 
hearth-rug, chessboard, armchair and mantelpiece of &#8216;Alice 
Through the Looking-Glass&#8217; are typical examples; the 
mantelpiece and spirit level of &#8216;Toyshop&#8217; make a 
simple puzzle, and the pile of building blocks a complicated
one; see also the scales in &#8216;Balances&#8217;.</p>

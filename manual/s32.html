<h2>&#167;32 &nbsp; Scope and what you can see</h2>

<blockquote>He cannot see beyond his own nose. Even the fingers he 
out-stretches from it to the world are (as I shall suggest) often invisible
to him.<br>&#8212; Max Beerbohm (1872&#8211;1956), of George Bernard Shaw</blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-241_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Time to say what &#8220;in scope&#8221; means. This definition is one 
of the most important rules of play, because it decides what the player
is allowed to refer to. You can investigate this experimentally by
compiling any game with the debugging suite of verbs included (see
<a href="s7.html">&#167;7</a>) and typing &#8220;scope&#8221; in 
interesting places. &#8220;In scope&#8221; roughly means &#8220;the
compass directions, what you're carrying and what you can see&#8221;. 
It exactly means this:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>the compass directions;</li>
<li>the player's immediate possessions;</li>
<li>if there is light, then the contents of the player's visibility 
ceiling (see <a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a> for definition, but 
roughly speaking the outermost object containing the player which
remains visible, which is usually the player's location);</li>
<li>if there is darkness, then the contents of the library's object 
<code>thedark</code> (by default there are no such contents, but 
some designers have been known to move objects into <code>thedark</code>: 
see &#8216;Ruins&#8217;);</li>
<li>if the player is inside a <code>container</code>, then that 
container;</li>
<li>if <i>O</i> is in scope and is see-through (see 
<a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a>), then the contents of <i>O</i>;</li>
<li>if <i>O</i> is in scope, then any object which it &#8220;adds 
to scope&#8221; (see below).</li>
</ol>

<p class="normal">with the proviso that the <code>InScope</code> entry 
point (see below) can add to or replace these rules, if you write one.</p>

<p class="indent">It's significant that rule (3) doesn't just say 
&#8220;whatever is in the current location&#8221;. For instance, if 
the player is in a closed cupboard in the Stores Room, then rule (3) 
means that the contents of the cupboard are in scope, but other items 
in the Stores Room are not.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in darkness the player's possessions are in 
scope, so the player can still turn on a lamp being carried. On the 
other hand, a player who puts the lamp on the ground and turns it off 
then loses the ability to turn it back on again, because it is out of 
scope. This can be changed; see below.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Compass directions make sense as things as well as directions, and 
they respond to names like &#8220;the south wall&#8221; and &#8220;the 
floor&#8221; as well as &#8220;south&#8221; and &#8220;down&#8221;.</p>

<a id="p242" name="p242"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The <code>concealed</code> attribute only hides objects from room 
descriptions, and doesn't remove them from scope. If you want things 
to be unreferrable-to, put them somewhere else!</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The small print: 1. For &#8220;player&#8221;, read &#8220;actor&#8221;. 
Thus &#8220;dwarf, drop sword&#8221; will be accepted if the dwarf can 
see the sword even if the player can't. 2. Scope varies depending on 
the token being parsed: for the <span class="grammartoken"><code>multi-</code></span> 
tokens, compass directions are not in scope; for 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>multiexcept</code></span> the other 
object isn't in scope; for <span class="grammartoken"><code>multiinside</code></span> 
only the contents of the other object are in scope.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Two library routines enable you to see what's in scope 
and what isn't. The first, <code>TestScope(obj, actor)</code>, simply 
returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> according to whether
or not <code>obj</code> is in scope. The second is 
<code>LoopOverScope(routine, actor)</code> and calls the given routine 
for each object in scope. In each case the <code>actor</code> given
is optional, and if it's omitted, scope is worked out for the player 
as usual.</p>

<b><a href="sa6.html#ans97">EXERCISE 97</a></b></span><br>
Implement the debugging suite's &#8220;scope&#8221; verb, which lists 
all the objects currently in scope.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans98">EXERCISE 98</a></b></span><br>
Write a &#8220;megalook&#8221; verb, which looks around and examines 
everything in scope except the walls, floor and ceiling.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Formally, scope determines what you can talk about, 
which usually means what you can see or hear. But what can you touch? 
Suppose a locked chest is inside a sealed glass cabinet. The Inform parser 
will allow the command &#8220;unlock chest with key&#8221; and generate 
the appropriate action, <code>&lt;Unlock chest key&gt;</code>, 
because the chest is in scope, so the command at least makes sense.</p>

<p class="indent">But it's impossible to carry out, because the player 
can't reach through the solid glass. So the library's routine for handling 
the <code>Unlock</code> action needs to enforce this. The library does 
this using a stricter rule called &#8220;touchability&#8221;. The 
rule is that you can touch anything in scope unless there's a closed
<code>container</code> between you and it. This applies either if 
you're in the container, or if it is.</p>

<p class="indent">Some purely visual actions, such as <code>Examine</code> 
or <code>LookUnder</code>, don't require touchability. But most actions 
are tactile, and so are many actions created by designers. If you 
want to make your own action routines enforce touchability, you can 
call the library routine <code>ObjectIsUntouchable(obj)</code>. This 
either returns <code>false</code> and prints nothing if there's no 
problem in touching <code>obj</code>, or 
<a id="p243" name="p243"></a>
returns <code>true</code> and 
prints a suitable message, such as &#8220;The solid glass cabinet is
in the way.&#8221; Thus, the first line of many of the library's 
action routines is:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (ObjectIsUntouchable(noun)) return;</pre>

<p class="normal">You can also call <code>ObjectIsUntouchable(obj, true)</code> 
to simply return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, printing nothing, 
if you'd rather provide your own failure message.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The rest of this section is about how to change the 
scope rules. As usual with Inform, you can change them globally, but 
it's more efficient and safer to work locally. To take a typical example: 
how do we allow the player to ask questions like the traditional 
&#8220;what is a grue&#8221;? The &#8220;grue&#8221; part ought to be 
parsed as if it were a noun, so that we could distinguish between, say, 
a &#8220;garden grue&#8221; and a &#8220;wild grue&#8221;. So it isn't 
good enough to look only at a single word. Here is one solution:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ QuerySub; 
  noun.description(); return;
];
[ QueryTopic;
  switch (scope_stage) {
      1: rfalse;
      2: ScopeWithin(questions); rtrue;
      3: &quot;At the moment, even the simplest questions confuse you.&quot;;
  }
];
Object questions;
</pre>

<p class="normal">where the actual questions at any time are the current 
children of the <code>questions</code> object, like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; &quot;long count&quot;
  with name 'long' 'count',
       description &quot;The Long Count is the great Mayan cycle of
           time, which began in 3114 BC and will finish with
           the world's end in 2012 AD.&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(which might be helpful in &#8216;Ruins&#8217;) 
and we also have a grammar line:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'what' * 'is'/'was' scope=QueryTopic -&gt; Query;</pre>

<p class="normal">The individual questions have short names so that 
the parser might be able to say &#8220;Which do you mean, the long count 
or the short count?&#8221; if the player asked &#8220;what is the 
count&#8221;. (As it stands this won't recognise &#8220;what is the
count?&#8221;. Conventionally players are supposed not to type question 
marks or quotes in their commands. To allow this one could always add 
<code>'count?'</code> as one of the names above.)</p>

<a id="p244" name="p244"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Here is the specification. When the parser reaches 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>scope=Whatever</code></span>, it 
calls the <code>Whatever</code> routine with the variable <code>scope_stage</code> 
set to 1. The routine should return <code>true</code> if it is prepared 
to allow multiple objects to be accepted here, and <code>false</code> 
otherwise. (In the example, as we don't want &#8220;what is
everything&#8221; to list all the questions and answers in the game, 
we return <code>false</code>.)</p>

<p class="indent">A little later the parser calls <code>Whatever</code> 
again with <code>scope_stage</code> now set to 2. <code>Whatever</code> 
is then obliged to tell the parser which objects are to be in scope.
It can call two parser routines to do this:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">ScopeWithin(obj)</pre>

<p class="normal">which puts everything inside <code>obj</code>, but 
not <code>obj</code> itself, into scope, and then works through rules 
(6) and (7) above, so that it may continue to add the contents of
the contents, and so on; and</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">PlaceInScope(obj)</pre>

<p class="normal">which puts just <code>obj</code> into scope. It is 
perfectly legal to declare something in scope that &#8220;would have been 
in scope anyway&#8221;: or something which is in a different room 
altogether from the actor concerned, say at the other end of a
telephone line. The scope routine <code>Whatever</code> should then 
return <code>false</code> if the nominated items are additional to the 
usual scope, or <code>true</code> if they are the only items in scope. 
(In the example, <code>QueryTopic</code> returns <code>true</code> because 
it wants the only items in scope to be its question topics, not the 
usual miscellany near the player.)</p>

<p class="indent">This is fine if the token is correctly parsed. If 
not, the parser may choose to ask the token routine to print a suitable 
error message, by calling <code>Whatever</code> with <code>scope_stage</code> 
set to 3. (In the example, this will happen if the player types
&#8220;what is the lgon count&#8221;, and <code>QueryTopic</code> 
replies &#8220;At the moment, even the simplest questions confuse you.&#8221;, 
because it comes from a faintly dream-like game called &#8216;Balances&#8217;.)</p>

Write a token which puts everything in scope, so that you could have 
a debugging &#8220;purloin&#8221; which could take anything, regardless 
of where it was and the rules applying to it.</p>

<a id="p245" name="p245"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The global scope rules can be tampered with by providing an entry 
point routine called <code>InScope(actor)</code>, where <code>actor</code> 
is the actor whose scope is worked out. In effect, this defines 
the &#8220;ordinary&#8221; scope by making calls to <code>ScopeWithin</code> 
and <code>PlaceInScope</code>, then returning <code>true</code> or 
<code>false</code>, exactly as if it were a scope token at stage 2. 
For instance, here as promised is how to change the rule that &#8220;things 
you've just dropped disappear in the dark&#8221;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ InScope person i;
  if (person == player &amp;&amp; location == thedark)
      objectloop (i in parent(player))
          if (i has moved) PlaceInScope(i);
  rfalse;
];
</pre>

<p class="aside">With this routine added, objects near the player in 
a dark room are in scope only if they have moved (that is, have been 
held by the player in the past), and even then are in scope only 
to the player, not to anyone else.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The token <span class="grammartoken"><code>scope=</code>&#8249;<span class="token">Routine</span>&#8250;</span>
takes precedence over <code>InScope</code>, which will only be reached 
if the routine returns <code>false</code> to signify &#8220;carry on&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
There are seven reasons why <code>InScope</code> might be being called; 
the <code>scope_reason</code> variable is set to the current one:</p>

<div class="inset"><dl>
<dt><code>PARSING_REASON</code></dt>
 <dd>The usual reason. Note that <code>action_to_be</code> holds 
 <code>NULL</code> in the early stages (before the verb has been decided)

<p class="normal">Each object has the ability to drag other objects into 
scope whenever it is in scope. This is especially useful for giving 
objects component parts: e.g., giving a washing-machine a temperature 
dial. (The dial can't be a child object because that would throw it 
in with the clothes: and it ought to be attached to the machine 
in case the machine is moved from place to place.) For this purpose, 
the property <code>add_to_scope</code> may contain a list of objects 
to add.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Alternatively, it may contain a routine. This routine can then call 
<code>AddToScope(x)</code> to add any object <code>x</code> to scope. 
It may not, however, call <code>ScopeWithin</code> or any other scoping 
routines.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Scope addition does <em>not</em> occur for an object moved into scope 
by an explicit call to <code>PlaceInScope</code>, since this must 
allow complete freedom in scope selections. But it does happen when 
objects are moved in scope by calls to <code>ScopeWithin(domain)</code>.</p>

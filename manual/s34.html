<h2>&#167;34 &nbsp; Linguistics and the Inform parser</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-253_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
&iexcl;Bienvenido a Aventura! Despite the English-language bias of early
computers and their manuals, interactive fiction has a culture and
a history beyond English, not least in Germany. Like the Monty
Python team and the Beatles, Infocom made a German translation
of their defining work, when in early 1988 Jeff O'Neill coded up 
&#8216;Zork I: Das Gro&#223;e Unterweltreich&#8217;. It came at a 
sorry time in Infocom's fortunes and remains officially unreleased, in 
part because the translator recruited had rendered the text in a 
stilted, business-German manner, though a beta-test of the story file 
circulates to this day. But O'Neill's work was not in vain, as it 
left another important legacy: an upgrading of the Z-machine format
to allow for accented characters, which opened the door to non-English 
IF on the Z-machine. Jose Luiz Diaz's translation of &#8216;Advent&#8217; 
into Spanish, as &#8216;Aventura&#8217;, stimulated much of the 
1996 development of Inform as a multilingual system, and Toni Arnold's 
game &#8216;Rummelplatzgeschichte&#8217; (1998) also deserves mention, 
as does advice from Inform users across four continents, among them 
Torbj&ouml;rn Andersson, Joachim Baumann, Paul David Doherty, Bjorn 
Gustavsson, Aapo Haapanen, Ralf Herrmann, J. P. Ikaheimonen, 
Ilario Nardinocchi, Bob Newell, Giovanni Riccardi and Linards 
Ticmanis. If nothing else, I am glad to have learned the palindromic 
Finnish word for soap dealer, &#8220;saippuakauppias&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">The standard English-language release of the Inform 
library now consists of eight files of code. Of these eight, only two 
need to be replaced to make a translation to another language: 
<tt>&quot;Grammar.h&quot;</tt>, which contains grammars for English 
verbs like &#8220;take&#8221; and &#8220;drop&#8221;; and a 
&#8220;language definition file&#8221; called <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>. 
For instance, in Ilario Nardinocchi's translation these 
<a id="p254" name="p254"></a>
two files are replaced by <tt>&quot;ItalianG.h&quot;</tt> and 
<tt>&quot;Italian.h&quot;</tt>, in Jose Luis Diaz's translation they 
become <tt>&quot;SpanishG.h&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;Spanish.h&quot;</tt> 
and so on. Language definition files can be useful for more, or rather 
less, than just translation. &#8216;The Tempest&#8217; (1997), for 
instance, uses a language definition file to enable it to speak in 
Early Modern English verse and to recognise pronouns like &#8220;thee&#8221;
and &#8220;thy&#8221;. A suitable language definition file could also 
change the persona of an Inform game from second-person (&#8220;You 
fall into a pit!&#8221;) to first-person (&#8220;I have fallen 
into a pit!&#8221;) or third (&#8220;Bilbo falls into a pit!&#8221;), 
or from present to past tenses, as Jamie Murphy's game &#8216;Leopold 
the Minstrel&#8217; (1996) did.</p>

<p class="indent">This section goes into the linguistics of the Inform 
parser, and how to add new grammatical concepts to it using grammar 
tokens. The next goes into full-scale translation and how to write 
new language definition files.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Language is complex, computers are simple. Modern English 
is a mostly non-inflected language, meaning that words tend not to alter 
their spelling according to their usage, but even here the parser has 
to go to some trouble to cope with one of its remaining inflections 
(&#8220;take coin&#8221; but &#8220;take six coins&#8221;: see 
<a href="s29.html">&#167;29</a>). The range of variation in human 
languages is large and as many are heavily inflected the task at first 
seems hopeless.&#8224;</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, Inform is mainly used with Romance-family 
languages, where commands are formed roughly as they are in English. 
The language understood by the parser is a simple one, called Informese. 
It has three genders, two numbers, a concept of animate versus 
inanimate nouns and a clear understanding of articles and pronouns, 
but all verbs are imperative, the only tense is the present, there 
are no cases of nouns (but see <a href="s35.html">&#167;35</a>) 
and adjectives are not distinguished from nouns (but see 
<a href="s26.html">&#167;26</a>). Informese is based on a small 
part of English, but the proposition of this chapter is that (with
some effort) you can find Informese at the core of many other languages 
as well.</p>

<p class="indent">Changes of vocabulary are obviously needed: for 
instance, where an English game recognises &#8220;other&#8221;, 
a French one must recognise &#8220;autre&#8221;. But, as the following 
example shows, vocabulary changes are not enough:</p>

<p class="syntax">jetez la boule dedans &nbsp; <i>throw the ball into it</i> (French)</p>

<p class="normal">has no word-for-word translation into Informese, because 
&#8220;dedans&#8221; (into it) is a pronominal adverb, and Informese 
doesn't have pronominal adverbs. 
<a id="p255" name="p255"></a>
Instead, a transformational rule like this one must be applied:</p>

<p class="syntax">dedans &nbsp; <i>inside it</i> &rarr; dans lui</p>

<p class="normal">Transformational rules like this one bring new 
grammatical structures into the Inform parser. The rest of this 
section is occupied with describing what is present already.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The following is a short grammar of Informese. Both 
here and in the General Index, grammatical concepts understood by 
the parser are written in angle brackets &#8249;<span class="token">like so</span>&#8250;.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Commands</i></p>

<p class="normal">A command to an Inform game should be one of:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">oops-word</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">word</span>&#8250;<br>
&#8249;<span class="token">action phrase</span>&#8250;<br>
&#8249;<span class="token">noun phrase</span>&#8250;, 
&#8249;<span class="token">action phrase</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">An &#8249;<span class="token">oops-word</span>&#8250; 
corrects the last command by putting the 
&#8249;<span class="token">word</span>&#8250; in to replace whatever
seemed to be incorrect. In <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>, the only 
words in the &#8249;<span class="token">oops-word</span>&#8250; 
category are &#8220;oops&#8221; and its abbreviation &#8220;o&#8221;. 
An &#8249;<span class="token">action phrase</span>&#8250; instructs 
the player to perform an action, unless it is preceded by a 
&#8249;<span class="token">noun phrase</span>&#8250; and a comma, 
in which case someone else is instructed to perform an action.</p>

<p class="indent">An &#8249;<span class="token">action phrase</span>&#8250; 
consists of a sequence of verb phrases, divided up by full stops or 
then-words: a &#8249;<span class="token">then-word</span>&#8250; is a 
word like the English &#8220;then&#8221; or a full stop. For
instance &#8220;take sword. east. put sword in stone&#8221; is broken 
into a sequence of three verb phrases, each parsed and acted on in 
turn. (It's important not to parse them all at once: the meaning of 
the noun phrase &#8220;stone&#8221; depends on where the player 
is by then.)</p>

<p>(2) <i>Verb phrases</i></p>

<p class="normal">A &#8249;<span class="token">verb phrase</span>&#8250; 
is one of:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">again-word</span>&#8250;<br>
&#8249;<span class="token">imperative verb</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">grammar line</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">Again-words are another category: in <tt>&quot;English.h&quot</tt>; 
these are &#8220;again&#8221; and its abbreviation &#8220;g&#8221;. 
An &#8249;<span class="token">again-word</span>&#8250; is understood 
as &#8220;the &#8249;<span class="token">verb phrase</span>&#8250; 
most recently typed in which wasn't an &#8249;<span class="token">again-word</span>&#8250;&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">The imperative is the form of the verb used for orders 
or instructions. In English the imperative (&#8220;open the window&#8221;) 
looks the same as the infinitive (&#8220;to open&#8221;), but in 
most languages they differ (French &#8220;ouvrez&#8221; is imperative, 
&#8220;ouvrir&#8221; infinitive). Even in many languages where verbs 
usually follow objects, such as Latin, the imperative comes at the 
start of a verb phrase, and Informese insists on this. Informese also 
<a id="p256" name="p256"></a>
wants the &#8249;<span class="token">imperative verb</span>&#8250; 
to be a single word, but programming can get around both requirements.</p>

<p class="indent">Grammar lines are sequences of tokens. Each token 
results in one of four grammatically different outcomes:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">noun phrase</span>&#8250;<br>
&#8249;<span class="token">preposition</span>&#8250;<br>
&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;<br>
&#8249;<span class="token">unparsed text</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">For instance, a successful match for the tokens 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>noun</code></span> or 
<span class="grammartoken"><code>multiheld</code></span> would produce
a &#8249;<span class="token">noun phrase</span>&#8250;, whereas a match 
for <span class="grammartoken"><code>'into'</code></span> would produce 
a &#8249;<span class="token">preposition</span>&#8250;. Note that a 
general parsing routine can produce any of these four outcomes.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Prepositions</i></p>

<p class="normal">Any word written in quotes as a grammar token. This 
is normally also a preposition in the ordinary grammatical sense, 
but not always, as the &#8220;press charges&#8221; example in 
<a href="s30.html">&#167;30</a> shows. In <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>, 
&#8220;look under table&#8221; and &#8220;switch on radio&#8221; contain 
two words considered to be prepositions in Informese: &#8220;under&#8221; 
and &#8220;on&#8221;.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Numbers</i></p>

<p class="normal">Include at least the numbers 1 to 20 written out in 
words. &#8220;At least&#8221; because a language definition file is 
free to include more, but should not include less.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Noun phrases</i></p>

<p class="normal">A string of words which refer to a single object or 
collection of objects, with more or less exactness. Here are some 
typical examples of <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> noun phrases:</p>

<p class="output">it<br>rucksack<br>brown bag, pepper<br>
a box and the other compass<br>nine silver coins<br>
everything except the rucksack<br>smooth stones</p>

<p class="normal">A noun phrase is a list of basic noun phrases:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">basic np</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">connective</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">basic np</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">connective</span>&#8250; &#8230;
&#8249;<span class="token">connective</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">basic np</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">and there are two kinds of connective: an 
&#8249;<span class="token">and-word</span>&#8250; (conjunction), 
and a &#8249;<span class="token">but-word</span>&#8250; (disjunction). 
The Inform parser always regards a comma in a 
&#8249;<span class="token">noun phrase</span>&#8250; (other than one 
used at the start of a command: see (1) above) as an 
&#8249;<span class="token">and-word</span>&#8250;, and the definition 
of <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> gives &#8220;and&#8221; as another. 
<tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> has two 
&#8249;<span class="token">but-words</span>&#8250;: &#8220;but&#8221; 
and &#8220;except&#8221;.</p>

<a id="p257" name="p257"></a>
<p class="indent">&#8249;<span class="token">Noun phrases</span>&#8250; 
being parsed are assigned several properties. They are declared 
<em>definite</em> if they carry no article, or a definite article which 
is not qualified by an all-word or a demanding number, and are otherwise 
<em>indefinite</em>. (Except that a noun-phrase containing a dictionary 
word flagged as likely to be referring to plural objects, such as 
<code>'crowns//p'</code>, is always indefinite.) Definiteness affects 
disambiguation and the parser's willingness to make guesses, as the 
description of the parser's disambiguation algorithm at the end 
of <a href="s33.html">&#167;33</a> shows.</p>

<p class="indent">Indefinite noun phrases also have a target quantity 
of objects being referred to: this is normally 1, but 7 for &#8220;seven 
stones&#8221; and 100, used internally to mean &#8220;as many as possible&#8221;, 
for &#8220;crowns&#8221; or &#8220;all the swords&#8221;. Noun phrases 
also have a <em>gender-number-animation</em> combination, or &#8220;GNA&#8221;:</p>

<div class="clump">
<p class="indent"><em>Gender</em>: in most European languages, nouns 
divide up into masculine, feminine or neuter, the three genders in 
Informese. Gender is important when parsing noun phrases because it 
can distinguish otherwise identical nouns, as in French: &#8220;le 
faux&#8221;, the forgery, &#8220;la faux&#8221;, the scythe. As in 
German, there may be no satisfactory way to determine the gender of 
a noun by any automatic rules: see the next section for how Inform 
assigns genders to nouns.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Number</em>: singular (&#8220;the hat&#8221;) 
or plural (&#8220;the grapes&#8221;). Individual objects in Inform
games can have names of either number. Languages with more than two 
numbers are rare, but Hebrew has a &#8220;pair of&#8221; number. This 
would have to be translated into a demanding number (see (7d) below) 
for Informese.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Animation</em>: Informese distinguishes between 
the animate (people and higher animals) and the inanimate (objects, plants 
and lower animals).</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">With three genders, two numbers and two animations, 
Informese has twelve possible GNA combinations, and these are internally 
represented by the numbers 0 to 11:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td>0</td><td valign="top" rowspan="6">animate</td>
 <td valign="top" rowspan="3">singular</td><td>masculine</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>feminine</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>neuter</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td valign="top" rowspan="3">plural</td><td>masculine</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>feminine</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>neuter</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td valign="top" rowspan="6">inanimate</td>
 <td valign="top" rowspan="3">singular</td><td>masculine</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>feminine</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>neuter</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td valign="top" rowspan="3">plural</td><td>masculine</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>feminine</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>neuter</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">Not all possible GNAs occur in all natural languages. 
In English, cases 6, 7, 9 and 10 never occur, except perhaps that ships 
are sometimes called &#8220;she&#8221; and &#8220;her&#8221; without
being animate (GNA 7). In French, 2, 5, 8 and 11 never occur. The parser 
actually works by assigning sets of possible GNA values to each noun 
phrase: so, in French, 
<a id="p258" name="p258"></a>
&#8220;le faux&#8221; carries the set {6}, while 
the more ambiguous noun phrase &#8220;les&#8221; carries {3,4,9,10}.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Basic noun phrases</i></p>

<p class="normal">These take the following form, in which both lists 
can have any number of words in, including none, and in any order:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">list of descriptors</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">list of nouns</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">For instance &#8220;the balloon&#8221; has one descriptor 
and one noun; &#8220;red balloon&#8221; has just two nouns; &#8220;all&#8221; 
has just one descriptor.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Descriptors</i></p>

<p class="normal">There are five kinds of &#8249;<span class="token">descriptor</span>&#8250;, 
as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-top:0">
<li>An &#8249;<span class="token">article</span>&#8250; is a word 
indicating whether a particular object is being referred to, or
merely one of a range. Thus there are two kinds of article,
<em>definite</em> and <em>indefinite</em>. <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> 
has four articles: &#8220;the&#8221; is definite, while &#8220;a&#8221;, 
&#8220;an&#8221; and &#8220;some&#8221; are indefinite.</li>
<li>An &#8249;<span class="token">all-word</span>&#8250; is a word 
which behaves like the English word &#8220;all&#8221;, that is, which
refers to a whole range of objects. Informese, like some natural languages 
(such as Tagalog), handles this as a kind of article but which pluralises 
what follows it.</li>
<li>An &#8249;<span class="token">other-word</span>&#8250; is a word 
behaving like &#8220;other&#8221;, which Informese understands as 
&#8220;other than the one I am holding&#8221;. Thus, if the player is 
holding a sword in a room where there's also a sword on the floor, then 
&#8220;examine other sword&#8221; would refer to the one on the floor.</li>
<li>A &#8249;<span class="token">demanding number</span>&#8250; is a word 
like &#8220;nine&#8221; in &#8220;nine bronze coins&#8221;, which demands 
that a certain number of items are needed.</li>
<li>A &#8249;<span class="token">possessive adjective</span>&#8250; is 
a word indicating ownership by someone or something whose meaning is 
held in a pronoun. Among others <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> has 
&#8220;my&#8221; (belonging to &#8220;me&#8221;); French has &#8220;son&#8221; 
(belonging to &#8220;lui&#8221;). Informese also counts 
&#8249;<span class="token">demonstrative adjectives</span>&#8250; like 
&#8220;this&#8221;, &#8220;these&#8221;, &#8220;that&#8221; and 
&#8220;those&#8221; as possessives, though demonstratives are hardly 
ever used by players and may not be worth providing in other languages. 
In Spanish, for instance, there would have to be twelve, for &#8220;this&#8221;, 
&#8220;that&#8221; (nearby) and &#8220;that&#8221; (far away), each 
in masculine, feminine, singular and plural forms; and the structure 
of &#8220;celui-ci&#8221; and &#8220;celui-la&#8221; in French is 
too complex to be worth the effort of parsing.</li>
</ol>

<p>(8) <i>Nouns</i></p>

<p class="normal">There are three kinds of &#8249;<span class="token">noun</span>&#8250;, 
as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-top:0">
<li>A &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250; is a word matched 
against particular objects. Unless an object has a <code>parse_name</code> 
routine attached, which complicates matters, these will be the words
in its <code>name</code> array. For instance:

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Object -&gt; &quot;blue box&quot; with name 'blue' 'box';</pre>

<a id="p259" name="p259"></a>
has two possible names in Informese, &#8220;blue&#8221; and &#8220;box&#8221;.</li>
<li>A &#8249;<span class="token">me-word</span>&#8250; is a word which 
behaves like the English word &#8220;me&#8221;, that is, which refers 
to the player-object. Most languages would think these are just examples 
of relative pronouns, but Informese considers them to be in a category 
of their own. Note that they refer to the player, whoever is addressed: 
in &#8220;mark, give me the bomb&#8221;, &#8220;me&#8221; refers to 
the speaker, not to Mark.</li>
<li>A &#8249;<span class="token">pronoun</span>&#8250; is a word which 
stands in the place of nouns and can only be understood with reference 
back to what has previously been said. &#8220;it&#8221;, &#8220;him&#8221;,
&#8220;her&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221; are all pronouns in <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>. 
(Though &#8220;her&#8221; can also be a possessive adjective, as in 
(7e) above.)</li>
</ol>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">It is worth mentioning a number of grammatical features 
which are <em>not</em> contained in Informese, along with some ways to 
simulate them.</p>

<div class="clump">
<p class="normal"><em>adverbs</em> such as &#8220;quickly&#8221; in 
&#8220;run quickly east&#8221;. These are not difficult to implement:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Verb 'run'
    * noun=ADirection -&gt; Go
    * 'quickly' noun=ADirection -&gt; GoQuickly
    * noun=ADirection 'quickly' -&gt; GoQuickly;
</pre>

<p class="normal">However, &#8220;The authors of Zork have thought about 
several possible extensions to the Zork parser. One that has come up 
many times is to add adverbs. A player should be able to do the following:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>go north quietly</tt><br>
You sneak past a sleeping lion who sniffs but doesn't wake up.</p>

<p class="normal">The problem is to think of reasons why you would 
not do everything &#8216;quietly&#8217;, &#8216;carefully&#8217; 
or whatever.&#8221; (P. David Lebling, &#8220;Zork and the Future of 
Computerized Fantasy Simulations&#8221;, <i>Byte</i>, December 1980.) 
A further problem is the impracticality of modelling the game world 
closely enough to differentiate between ways to achieve the same action. 
In Melbourne House's &#8216;The Hobbit&#8217; adverbs influence the 
probability of success in randomised events, so for instance &#8220;throw 
rope vigorously across river&#8221; is more likely to succeed than 
&#8220;throw rope across river&#8221;, but those few players who discovered 
this were not pleased. Twenty years on from &#8216;Zork&#8217;, adverbs 
remain largely unused in the medium.</p>

<p class="normal"><em>adjectives</em> are not distinguished from 
nouns, although it can be useful to do so when resolving ambiguities.

gets this right because they look the same as demonstrative adjectives

expand &#8220;mine&#8221; to &#8220;my <i>X</i>&#8221;, where

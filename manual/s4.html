This chapter introduces five fundamentals of Inform: how to
construct games; messages, classes and actions; and how to debug games. 
<a href="ch3.html">Chapter III</a> then makes a systematic exploration 
of the model world available to Inform games. Throughout both chapters,
examples gradually build up a modest game called &#8216;Ruins&#8217;, 
a tale of Central American archaeology in the 1930s. Here is its 
first state:</p>

<p class="normal">If you can compile this tiny beginning successfully, 
Inform is probably set up and working properly on your computer. 
Compilation may take a few seconds, because although you have only 
written twenty lines or so, the <code>Include</code> directives paste 
in another seven and a half thousand. This is &#8220;the 
Library&#8221;, a computer program which acts as umpire during play. 
The library is divided into three parts:</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>Parser&nbsp;</code> &nbsp;
which decodes what the player types;<br>
<code>VerbLib</code> &nbsp; how actions, like &#8220;take&#8221; or 
&#8220;go north&#8221;, work;<br>
<code>Grammar</code> &nbsp; the verbs and phrases which the game 
understands.</p>

<p class="normal">It does matter what order the three lines beginning 
with <code>Include</code> come in, and it sometimes matters where 
your own code goes with respect to them: objects shouldn't be declared 
until after the inclusion of the parser, for instance. For now, 
follow the structure above, with everything interesting placed between
the inclusions of <code>VerbLib</code> and <code>Grammar</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
<a href="ch1.html">Chapter I</a> above said that every Inform program 
had to contain a routine called <code>Main</code>. Games like &#8216;Ruins&#8217; 
are no exception, but their <code>Main</code> routine is part of 
the library, so that game designers do not need to write a <code>Main</code>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The two constants at the beginning are text giving 
the game's name and copyright message, which the library needs in 
order to print out the &#8220;banner&#8221; announcing the game. 
Similarly, the library expects to find a routine named <code>Initialise</code> 
somewhere in your source code. This routine is called when the game 
starts up, and is expected to carry out any last setting-up operations
before play begins. In most games, it also prints up a &#8216;welcome&#8217; 
message, but the one thing it has to do is to set the <code>location</code> 
variable to the place where the player begins. And this means that every 
game has to declare at least one object, too: the room where the player 
begins.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
In this book places are often called &#8220;rooms&#8221; even when 
outdoors (like <code>Forest</code>) or underground. This goes back 
at least to Stephen Bishop's 1842 map of the Mammoth and Flint Ridge 
cave system of Kentucky, which was the setting of the first adventure
game, &#8216;Advent&#8217;, also called &#8216;Colossal Cave&#8217; 
(c.1975). The author, Will Crowther, was a 
<a id="p86" name="p86"></a>
caver and used the word 
&#8220;room&#8221; in its caving sense. Don Woods, who recast the game
in 1976&#8211;7, confused the word further with its everyday sense. 
Players of adventure games continue to call locations &#8220;rooms&#8221; 
to this day.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In an Inform game, objects are used to simulate 
everything: rooms and items to be picked up, scenery, the player, 
intangible things like mist and even some abstract ideas, like 
the direction &#8220;north&#8221; or the idea of &#8220;darkness&#8221;. 
The library itself is present as an object, called <code>InformLibrary</code>, 
though like the concept of &#8220;north&#8221; it cannot be picked 
up or visited during play. All told, &#8216;Ruins&#8217; already
contains twenty-four objects.</p>

<p class="indent">It is time to add something tangible, by writing 
the following just after the definition of <code>Forest</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; mushroom &quot;speckled mushroom&quot;
  with name 'speckled' 'mushroom' 'fungus' 'toadstool';
</pre>

<a id="p87" name="p87"></a>
<p class="normal">The arrow <code>-&gt;</code> means that the mushroom 
begins inside the previous object, which is to say, the <code>Forest</code>. 
If the game is recompiled, the mushroom is now in play: the player 
can call it &#8220;speckled mushroom&#8221;, &#8220;mushroom&#8221;, 
&#8220;toadstool&#8221; and so on. It can be taken, dropped, looked 
at, looked under and so on. However, it only adds the rather plain 
line &#8220;There is a speckled mushroom here.&#8221; to the 
Forest's description. Here is a more decorative species:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; mushroom &quot;speckled mushroom&quot;
  with name 'speckled' 'mushroom' 'fungus' 'toadstool',
       initial
           &quot;A speckled mushroom grows out of the sodden earth, on
           a long stalk.&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The <code>initial</code> message is used to tell the player 
about the mushroom when the Forest is described. 
(Once the mushroom has been picked or moved, the message is no longer 
used: hence the name &#8216;initial&#8217;.) The mushroom is, however, 
still &#8220;nothing special&#8221; when the player asks to &#8220;look 
at&#8221; or &#8220;examine&#8221; it. To provide a more interesting 
close-up view, we must give the mushroom its own <code>description</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; mushroom &quot;speckled mushroom&quot;
  with name 'speckled' 'mushroom' 'fungus' 'toadstool',
       initial
           &quot;A speckled mushroom grows out of the sodden earth, on
           a long stalk.&quot;,
       description
           &quot;The mushroom is capped with blotches, and you aren't
           at all sure it's not a toadstool.&quot;,
  has  edible;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Now if we examine the mushroom, as is always wise, 
we get a cautionary hint. But the edible notation means that it 
<em>can</em> be eaten, so that for the first time the player can 
change the game state irrevocably: from a game with a forest and 
a mushroom into a game with just a forest.</p>

<p class="indent">The mushroom shows the two kinds of feature something 
can have: a &#8220;property&#8221; with some definite value or list 
of values and an &#8220;attribute&#8221;, which is either present 
or not but has no particular value. <code>name</code>, <code>initial</code> 
and <code>description</code> are all properties, while <code>light</code> 
and <code>edible</code> are attributes. The current state of these 
properties changes during play: for instance, it can be changed 
by code like the following.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
mushroom.description = &quot;You're sure it's a toadstool now.&quot;;
give mushroom light;
if (mushroom has edible) print &quot;It's definitely edible.^&quot;;
</pre>

<a id="p88" name="p88"></a>
<p class="normal"><code>light</code> is the attribute for &#8220;giving 
off light&#8221;. The <code>Forest</code> was defined as having <code>light</code> 
on account of daylight, so it doesn't much matter whether or not the
mushroom has <code>light</code>, but for the sake of botanical 
verisimilitude it won't have <code>light</code> in the final game.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Declaring objects has so far been a matter of filling 
in forms: fill some text into the box marked <code>description</code>, 
and so on. We could go much further like this, but for the sake of 
example it's time to add some rules:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
after [;
    Take: &quot;You pick the mushroom, neatly cleaving its thin stalk.&quot;;
    Drop: &quot;The mushroom drops to the ground, battered slightly.&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">The property <code>after</code> doesn't just have 
a string for a value: it has a routine of its own. What happens is 
that after something happens to the mushroom, the library asks 
the mushroom if it would like to react in some way. In this case,
it reacts only to <code>Take</code> and <code>Drop</code>, and 
the only effect is that the usual messages (&#8220;Taken.&#8221; 
&#8220;Dropped.&#8221;) are replaced by new ones. (It doesn't react 
to <code>Eat</code>, so nothing out of the ordinary happens when 
it's eaten.) &#8216;Ruins&#8217; can now manage a briefly plausible 
dialogue:</p>

<p class="output"><em>&#8220;Great Plaza&#8221;</em><br>
Or so your notes call this low escarpment of limestone, but the rainforest 
has claimed it back. Dark olive trees crowd in on all sides, the air 
steams with the mist of a warm recent rain, midges hang in the air. 
&#8220;Structure 10&#8221; is a shambles of masonry which might once 
have been a burial pyramid, and little survives except stone-cut 
steps leading down into darkness below.<br>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Gareth Rees persuasively advocates writing this 
sort of transcript, of an ideal sequence of play, first, and worrying 
about how to code up the design afterwards. Other designers prefer 
to build from the bottom up, crafting the objects one at a time and
finally bringing them together into the narrative.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p89" name="p89"></a>
<p class="normal">The mushroom is a little more convincing now, but 
still does nothing. Here is a more substantial new rule:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
before [;
    Eat: if (random(100) &lt;= 30) {
             deadflag = true;
             &quot;The tiniest nibble is enough. It was a toadstool,
             and a poisoned one at that!&quot;;
         }
         &quot;You nibble at one corner, but the curious taste
         repels you.&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">The library consults <code>before</code> just before 
the player's intended action would take place. So when the player 
tries typing, say, &#8220;eat the mushroom&quot;, what happens is: 
in 30% of cases, death by toadstool poisoning; and in the other 70%, 
a nibble of a corner of fungus, without consuming it completely.</p>

<p class="indent">Like <code>location</code>, <code>deadflag</code> is 
a variable belonging to the library. It's normally <code>false</code>, 
meaning that the player is still alive and playing. Setting it to
<code>true</code> thus kills the player. (Setting it to 2 causes the 
player to win the game and there are other uses: see
<a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent">If the &#8220;tiniest nibble&#8221; text is printed, 
the rule ends there, and does not flow on into the second &#8220;You 
nibble at&#8221; text. So one and only one message is printed. 
Here is how this is achieved: although it's not obvious from the look
of the program, the <code>before</code> routine is being asked the 
question &#8220;Do you want to interfere with the usual rules?&#8221;. 
It must reply, that is, return, either <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code> meaning yes or no. Because this question is asked 
and answered many times in a large Inform game, there are several 
abbreviations for how to reply. For example,</p>

<p class="syntax"><code>return true;</code> &nbsp; and &nbsp;
<code>rtrue;</code></p>

<p class="normal">both do the same thing. Moreover,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">print_ret &quot;The tiniest nibble... ...at that!&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">performs three useful tasks: prints the message, then 
prints a carriage return, and then returns <code>true</code>. And this 
is so useful that a bare string</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">&quot;The tiniest nibble... ...at that!&quot;;</pre>

<a id="p90" name="p90"></a>
<p class="normal">is understood to mean the same thing. To print the text 
without returning, the statement <code>print</code> has to be written 
out in full. Here is an example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
before [;
    Taste: print &quot;You extend your tongue nervously.^&quot;;
        rfalse;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">In this rule, the text is printed, but the answer 
to &#8220;Do you want to interfere?&#8221; is no, so the game will 
then go on to print something anodyne like &#8220;You taste nothing 
unexpected.&#8221; (In fact the <code>rfalse</code> was unnecessary, 
because if a rule like this never makes any decision, then the answer 
is assumed to be false.)</p>

<a id="ex1" name="ex1"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans1">EXERCISE 1</a></b></span><br>
The present <code>after</code> routine for the mushroom is 
misleading, because it says the mushroom has been picked every time 
it's taken (which will be odd if it's taken, dropped then taken again). 
Correct this.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The following example of &#8220;form-filling&#8221; 
is typical of the way that the library provides for several standard 
kinds of object. This one is a kind of door, which will be gone into 
properly in <a href="s13.html">&#167;13</a>, but for now suffice to 
say that a door doesn't literally have to be a door: it can be any 
object which comes in between where the player is and where the 
player can go. Because the object is also marked as <code>scenery</code> 
(see <a href="s8.html">&#167;8</a>), it isn't given any special paragraph 
of description when the Forest is described. Finally, it is marked 
as <code>static</code> to prevent the player from being able to pick 
it up and walk off with it.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; steps &quot;stone-cut steps&quot;
  with name 'steps' 'stone' 'stairs' 'stone-cut' 'pyramid' 'burial'
            'structure' 'ten' '10',
       description
           &quot;The cracked and worn steps descend into a dim chamber.
           Yours might be the first feet to tread them for five
           hundred years.&quot;,
       door_to Square_Chamber,
       door_dir d_to
  has  scenery static door open;
</pre>

<p class="normal">We also need to add a new line to the Forest's 
definition to tell it that the way down is by these steps:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object Forest &quot;~Great Plaza~&quot;
       ...
       d_to steps,
</pre>

<a id="p91" name="p91"></a>
<p class="normal">Now &#8220;examine structure 10&#8221;, &#8220;enter 
stone-cut pyramid&#8221; and so forth will all work.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans2">EXERCISE 2</a></b></span><br>
Except of course that now &#8216;Ruins&#8217; won't compile, because 
Inform expects to find a room called <code>Square_Chamber</code> 
which the steps lead to. Design one.</p>

Inform is a system for creating adventure games, and this is the book to read 
about it. It translates an author's textual description into 
a simulated world which can be explored by readers using almost 
any computer, with the aid of an &#8220;interpreter&#8221; program.</p>

<p class="indent">Inform is a suite of software, called the &#8220;library&#8221;, 
as well as a compiler. Without the library, it would be a major undertaking 
to design even the smallest game. The library has two ingredients: the 
&#8220;parser&#8221;, which tries to make sense of the player's typed 
commands, and the &#8220;world model&#8221;, a complex web of standard 
rules, such as that people can't see without a source of light. Given these, 
the designer only needs to describe places and items, mentioning any
exceptional rules that apply. (&#8220;There is a bird here, which is a 
normal item except that you can't pick it up.&#8221;) This manual describes 
Inform 6.21 (or later), with library 6/9 (or later), but earlier Inform 
6 releases are similar.</p>

<p class="indent">Since its invention in 1993, Inform has been used to 
design some hundreds of works of interactive fiction, in eight languages, 
reviewed in periodicals ranging in specialisation from
<i>XYZZYnews</i> (<tt>www.xyzzynews.com</tt>) to 
<i>The New York Times</i> (see Edward Rothstein's &#8216;Connections&#8217; 
column for 6 April 1998). It accounts for around ten thousand postings 
per year to Internet newsgroups. Commercially, Inform has been used as 
a multimedia games prototyping tool. Academically, it has turned up in 
syllabuses and seminars from computer science to theoretical architecture, 
and appears in books such as <i>Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic 
Literature</i> (E. J. Aarseth, Johns Hopkins Press, 1997). Having started 
as a revival of the then-disused Infocom adventure game format, the 
&#8220;Z-Machine&#8221;, Inform came full circle when it produced Infocom's 
only text game of the 1990s: &#8216;Zork: The Undiscovered Underground&#8217;, 
by Mike Berlyn and Marc Blank.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, Inform is not the only system available, 
and the intending game designer should shop around. This author at least 
has long admired the elegance of Mike Roberts's Text Adventure Development 
System (TADS).</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In trying to be both a tutorial and reference work, this 
book aims itself in style halfway between the two extremes of manual, 
Tedium and Gnawfinger's <i>Elements of Batch Processing in COBOL-66</i>, 
third edition, and Mr Blobby's <i>Blobby Book of Computer Fun</i>. 
(This makes some sections both leaden <em>and</em> patronising.)
Diversionary or seldom-needed passages are marked with a warning 
triangle &#9650; or two. Examples of program are set in <tt>typewriter</tt> 
font.</p>

<a id="p12" name="p12"></a>
<p class="indent">Mundane or irrelevant passages in longer examples 
are sometimes replaced with a line reading just &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;. 
Further examples are couched instead as exercises, with answers 
given in <a href="sa6.html">&#167;A6</a>. Many are intended not for 
first readers but to help those returning for some variation on the 
usual rules.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="ch1.html">Chapter I</a> introduces the 
language used to describe games without doing any actual game design. 
The real flavour of Inform begins in <a href="ch2.html">Chapter 
II</a>, so that readers may want to begin there, turning back to 
<a href="ch1.html">Chapter I</a> only as needed. Equally, the 
essential material designers need is mostly done by halfway through 
<a href="ch4.html">Chapter IV</a>, so the book is not as epic 
as it looks.</p>

<p class="indent">One way to get a feeling for Inform is to design a 
simple game and to add an example of each new feature as it turns up. 
This book does just that with an eleven-location short story of 1930s 
archaeology, called &#8216;Ruins&#8217;, taking it from opening 
lines in <a href="s4.html">&#167;4</a> to a completed work with 
a step-by-step solution by the end of <a href="s23.html">&#167;23</a>.
Other example games for Inform include &#8216;Advent&#8217;, 
&#8216;Adventureland&#8217;, &#8216;Balances&#8217;, 
&#8216;Toyshop&#8217; and &#8216;Museum of Inform&#8217;.</p>

<p class="normal">The Alexandrian Library of the interactive fiction 
world is an anonymous FTP site at the German National Research Centre 
for Computer Science, where Volker Blasius and David Kinder maintain 
the archive:</p>

<p class="output"><tt>ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/</tt></p>

<p class="normal">Its unrivalled collection of early and modern interactive 
fiction (IF), including two dozen rival design systems, makes
<tt>ftp.gmd.de</tt> the essential port of call for the IF tourist.
Also archived are &#8220;library extensions&#8221; and translations 
of Inform, and the source code of around fifty Inform-written 
games. Inform's home on the World Wide Web, which includes Gareth 
Rees's &#8216;Alice Through the Looking-Glass&#8217; tutorial, is 
located at:</p>

<p class="output"><tt>http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/inform.html</tt></p>

<p class="normal">Here you can find a PDF (&#8220;Acrobat&#8221;) 
copy of this book; <i>The Inform Technical Manual</i>, a dry account 
of internal workings for the benefit of those working on the compiler; 
and <i>The Z-Machine Standards Document</i>, which minutely defines
the run-time format.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Stop press: as this book goes to the printers, the 
archive is in the early stages of migrating to <tt>ftp.ifarchive.org</tt>, 
a process likely to be complete by end 2001.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p13" name="p13"></a>
<p class="indent">Much of this book is given over to syntax and implementation, 
but the world model and its underlying rules are at the heart of Inform, 
and they owe much to earlier work in the field. Ideas of how to represent 
places and the location of items are owed to Will Crowther (c. 1975), 
while the use of a tree to represent containment derives from work towards 
&#8216;Zork&#8217; (c. 1978) by students at MIT, whose artificial 
intelligence lab promoted the doctrine that such structures occur 
&#8220;naturally&#8221;. (Terry Winograd's &#8216;SHRDLU&#8217; (1972) 
had provided an adventure-like parser for a world of blocks supporting 
pyramids: it recognised pronouns, and allowed the &#8220;game&#8221; 
state to be saved.) The completion of today's standard model of space, 
objects, lighting and the passage of time can conveniently be dated 
to April 1979, the publication date of the influential <i>IEEE 
Computer</i> article &#8216;Zork: A Computerized Fantasy Simulation 
Game&#8217; by P. David Lebling, Marc Blank and Tim Anderson. The question 
of how best to model supplementary world rules, of the &#8220;you 
can't pick up the slippery eel&#8221; variety, is less settled. 
Influenced by post-&#8216;Zork&#8217; Infocom, TADS (c. 1987) has a 
&#8220;verification stage&#8221; in processing actions, for instance, 
which may well be a better scheme than Inform's before and after. 
The latter derive from a second tradition, based in Cambridge, England, 
not Cambridge, Massachusetts: in the first instance from an incremental 
multi-player game called &#8216;Tera&#8217; for the Cambridge University 
mainframe Phoenix, written by Dilip Sequeira and the author in 1990. 
(The compiler was called Teraform, a pun of Dr Sequeira's. &#8216;Tera&#8217; 
was the sequel to &#8216;Giga&#8217; and before that &#8216;Mega&#8217;
&#8211; anagram of &#8216;game&#8217; &#8211; by Mark Owen and Matthew 
Richards.) This stole from the vastly more significant Phoenix game 
assembler by David Seal and Jonathan Thackray which in turn dates back 
to their creation, with Jonathan Partington, of &#8216;Acheton&#8217; (c. 1979), 
the first substantial game written outside America.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In the defensive words of its first, makeshift documentation, 
&#8220;Inform is an easel, not a painting&#8221;. Though I am no longer 
so sure that the two can be divided. While revising this book, I have 
been ruefully reminded of Coleridge's notebooks, that vaulted miscellany 
of staircases and <a href="s50.html#p397_4">hidden doors</a>, 
connections found and lost, plans abandoned and made again. Slipping 
away from my attempts to index and organise it, this book, too, remains 
for me a maze of twisty little passages, all different, a kind of interactive 
fiction in itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Over the last seven years, more than a thousand people 
have trodden these passages, repairing or ramifying by turns with 
amendments and suggestions: far too many to name but I would like to 
thank them all, and especially Volker Blasius, Kevin Bracey, Mark 
Howell, Stefan Jokisch, Kirk Klobe,
<a id="p14" name="p14"></a>
the ever avuncular Bob Newell, Robert Pelak, J&oslash;rund 
Rian, Dilip Sequeira, Richard Tucker, Christopher Wichura, John Wood 
and the games designers of Activision. Particular thanks go to Mike Berlyn, 
who besides being one of the subjects of <a href="ch8.html">Chapter 
VIII</a> was also instrumental in the reshaping of this text as an 
unabashed book. His enthusiasm was greatly valued.</p>

<p class="indent">Few books can have been so fortunate in receiving the 
generous attention of others as this new edition. First and foremost 
its every paragraph was reshaped by Gareth Rees's skilled, tactful 
and invariably wise editing. The stack of proofs of draft chapters, 
meticulously annotated in his calligraphic handwriting, is now five and 
a half inches high; his contribution to the ideas in this book was equally 
substantial, and especially in <a href="ch8.html">Chapter VIII</a>. 
Toby Nelson and Andrew Plotkin each proof-read the text, making helpful 
comments such as &#8220;Had a bad day at the office?&#8221; next to one 
of the paragraphs, and &#8220;Inform is curled up in my head, like a 
parasitic alien that doesn't spring out and eat the host for a 
surprisingly long time.&#8221; Torbj&ouml;rn Andersson checked the 
solutions to the exercises: no mean feat, and it resulted in no less than 
242 specific suggestions, only four of them pointing out that I'd got 
the accent in his name wrong again. Later on he proofed the whole book 
again, so that at times it seemed it would never be finished (delays, 
however, being solely my own fault). Michael Baum's census of known 
Z-machine story files greatly assisted the bibliography of cited works. 
Paul David Doherty, interactive fiction's most careful and dedicated 
historian, was tireless in tracking down early games designers and 
in vetting <a href="s46.html">&#167;46</a> for factual accuracy, 
and interviews by Dennis G. Jerz further clarified the mid-1970s picture: 
opinions and errors remain, of course, my own. David Cornelson's enthusiasm 
and capability made this printed edition possible, assisted by Roger 
Firth and Florian Edlbauer as English and German agents, and by Ryan 
Freebern, Duncan Stevens, Nick Montfort and Duncan Cross who proofed pages 
yet again. Inform designers too numerous to name participated in a 
survey of what they would like to see appearing in this book, and in a 
trawling exercise for misprints in the first PDF edition. A generous 
award from the Society of Authors in 1997 allowed me more time for 
writing. The herculean labour of producing this excellent HTML edition
of the book fell to David Welbourn, with the assistance of
David Cornelson.</p>

<p class="indent">One final word. I should like to dedicate this book, 
impertinently perhaps, to our illustrious predecessors: Will Crowther, 
Don Woods and the authors of Infocom, Inc.; among them Douglas Adams, 
whose sudden death only weeks ago robs us of one of our most inventive 
and maddening writers.</p>

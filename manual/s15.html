<h2>&#167;15 &nbsp; Things to enter, travel in and push around</h2>

<blockquote>Vehicles were objects that became, in effect, mobile rooms&#8230;
The code for the boat itself was not designed to function outside the
river section, but nothing kept the player from carrying the deflated
boat to the reservoir and trying to sail across&#8230;<br>
&#8212; Tim Anderson, <i>The History of Zork</i></blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-137_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Quite so. Even the case of an entirely static object which can be
climbed into or onto poses problems of realism. Sitting on a garden
roller, is one in the gardens, or not? Can one reasonably reach to
pick up a leaf on the ground? The Inform library leaves most of these 
subtleties to the designer but has at least a general concept of 
&#8220;enterable object&#8221;. These have <code>enterable</code> and 
the <code>Enter</code> and <code>Exit</code> actions allow the
player to get in (or on) and out (or off) of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Enterable items might include, say, an open-topped car, a 
psychiatrist's couch or even a set of manacles attached to a dungeon 
wall. In practice, though, manacles are an exceptional case, and 
one usually wants to make an <code>enterable</code> thing also a <code>container</code>, 
or &#8211; as in the case of the altar from &#8216;Ruins&#8217;
which appeared in the previous section &#8211; a <code>supporter</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; stone_table &quot;slab altar&quot;
  with name 'stone' 'table' 'slab' 'altar' 'great',
       initial &quot;A great stone slab of a table, or altar, dominates the
           Shrine.&quot;,
  has  enterable supporter static;
</pre>

<p class="normal">A chair to sit on, or a bed to lie down on, should 
also be a <code>supporter</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting on furniture, one is hardly in a different location altogether. 
But suppose the player climbs into a <code>container</code> which is not <code>transparent</code> 
and then closes it from the inside? To all intents and purposes this 
has become another room. The interior may be dark, but if there's 
light to see by, the player will want to see some kind of room description. 
In any case, many enterable objects ought to look different from inside 
or on top. Inside a vehicle, a player might be able to see a steering 
wheel and a dashboard, for instance. On top of a cupboard, it might 
be possible to see through a skylight window.</p>

<p class="indent">For this purpose, any <code>enterable</code> object can provide a property called
<code>inside_description</code>, which can hold a string of text or 
else a routine to print some text, as usual.
If the exterior location is still visible, then the &#8220;inside
description&#8221; is appended to the normal room description; if 
not, it replaces the 
<a id="p138" name="p138"></a>
room description altogether. As an extreme example, 
suppose that the player gets into a huge cupboard, closes the door 
and then gets into a plastic cabinet inside that. The resulting room 
description might read like so:</p>

<p class="output"><em>The huge cupboard (in the plastic cabinet)</em><br>
It's a snug little cupboard in here, almost a room in itself.<br>
In the huge cupboard you can see a pile of clothes.<br>
The plastic walls of the cabinet distort the view.</p>

<p class="normal">The second line is the <code>inside_description</code> 
for the huge cupboard, and the fourth is that for the plastic cabinet.</p>

(Also from &#8216;Ruins&#8217;.) Implement a cage which can be opened, 
closed and entered.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">All the classic games have vehicles (like boats, 
or fork lift trucks, or hot air balloons) which the player can journey 
in, and Inform makes this easy. Here is a simple case:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object car &quot;little red car&quot; cave
  with name 'little' 'red' 'car',
       description &quot;Large enough to sit inside. Among the controls is a
           prominent on/off switch. The numberplate is KAR 1.&quot;,
       when_on
           &quot;The red car sits here, its engine still running.&quot;,
       when_off &quot;A little red car is parked here.&quot;,
       before [;
           Go: if (car has on) &quot;Brmm! Brmm!&quot;;
               print &quot;(The ignition is off at the moment.)^&quot;;
       ],
  has  switchable enterable static container open;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Actually, this demonstrates a special rule. If 
a player is inside an <code>enterable</code> object and tries to 
move, say &#8220;north&#8221;, the before routine for the object 
is called with the action <code>Go n_obj</code>. It may then return:</p>

<p class="output">0 &nbsp; to disallow the movement, printing a refusal;<br>
1 &nbsp; to allow the movement, moving vehicle and player;<br>
2 &nbsp; to disallow but print and do nothing; or<br>
3 &nbsp; to allow but print and do nothing.</p>

<p class="normal">If you want to move the vehicle in your own code, 
return 3, not 2: otherwise the old location may be restored by subsequent 
workings. Notice that if you write no code, the default value <code>false</code> 
will always be returned, so enterable objects won't become 
vehicular unless you write them that way.</p>

<a id="p139" name="p139"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Because you might want to drive the car &#8220;out&#8221; of a 
garage, the &#8220;out&#8221; verb does not make the player get out 
of the car. Instead the player generally has to type something
like &#8220;get out&#8221; or &#8220;exit&#8221; to make this happen.</p>

<a id="ex23" name="ex23"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans23">EXERCISE 23</a></b></span><br>
Alter the car so that it will only drive along roads, and not through 
all map connections.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Objects like the car or, say, an antiquated wireless 
on casters, are too heavy to pick up but the player should at least 
be able to push them from place to place. When the player tries to 
do this, an action like <code>PushDir wireless</code> is generated.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, if the <code>before</code> routine for the 
wireless returns <code>false</code>, the game will just say that 
the player can't move the wireless; and if it returns <code>true</code>, 
the game will do nothing at all, assuming that the <code>before</code> 
routine has already printed something more interesting. So how does 
one actually tell Inform that the push should be allowed? The answer 
is: first call the <code>AllowPushDir</code> routine (a library 
routine), and then return true. For example (&#8216;Ruins&#8217; 
again), here is a ball on a north-south corridor which slopes upward 
at the northern end:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; huge_ball &quot;huge pumice-stone ball&quot;
  with name 'huge' 'pumice' 'pumice-stone' 'stone' 'ball',
       description
           &quot;A good eight feet across, though fairly lightweight.&quot;,
       initial
           &quot;A huge pumice-stone ball rests here, eight feet wide.&quot;,
       before [;
           PushDir:
               if (location == Junction &amp;&amp; second == ne_obj)
                   &quot;The Shrine entrance is far less than eight feet
                   wide.&quot;;
               AllowPushDir(); 
               rtrue;
           Pull, Push, Turn:
               &quot;It wouldn't be so very hard to get rolling.&quot;;
           Take, Remove:
               &quot;There's a lot of stone in an eight-foot sphere.&quot;;
       ],
       after [;
           PushDir:
               if (second == s_obj)
                   &quot;The ball is hard to stop once underway.&quot;;
               if (second == n_obj)
                   &quot;You strain to push the ball uphill.&quot;;<a id="p140" name="p140"></a>
       ],
  has  static;

The library does not normally allow pushing objects up or down. How 
can the pumice ball allow this?</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
For an <code>enterable supporter</code> puzzle, see the magic carpet in 
&#8216;Balances&#8217; (and several items in &#8216;Alice Through 
the Looking-Glass&#8217;). &nbsp;
<span class="warning">&#8226</span>When a vehicle has a sealed 
interior large enough to be a location, it is probably best handled 
as a location with changing map connections and not as a <code>vehicle</code> 
object moved from room to room. See for instance Martin Braun's 
<tt>&quot;elevator.inf&quot;</tt> example game, providing an elevator 
which serves eight floors of a building.</p>

<h2>&#167;40 &nbsp; Error messages</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-300_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Five kinds of error are reported by Inform: a fatal error is a
breakdown severe enough to make Inform stop working at once; an
error allows Inform to continue for the time being, but will normally
cause Inform not to output the story file (because it is suspected
of being damaged); and a warning means that Inform suspects you may have
made a mistake, but will not take any action itself. The fourth kind 
is an ICL error, where a mistake has been made in a file of ICL commands 
for Inform to follow: an error on the command line is called a 
&#8220;command line error&#8221; but is just another way to get an 
ICL error. And the fifth is a compiler error, which appears if Inform's 
internal cross-checking shows that it is malfunctioning. The text 
reporting a compiler error asks the user to report it the author of
Inform.</p>

<h3>Fatal errors</h3>

<h4>1. <i>Too many errors</i></h4>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre>Too many errors: giving up</pre>

<p class="normal">After 100 errors, Inform stops, in case it has been 
given the wrong source file altogether, such as a program written in 
a different language.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>2. <i>Input/output problems</i></h4>

<p class="normal">Most commonly, Inform has the wrong filename:</p>

<p><tt>Couldn't open source file 
</tt>&#8249;<span class="token">filename</span>&#8250;<br>
<tt>Couldn't open output file 
</tt>&#8249;<span class="token">filename</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">(and so on). More seriously the whole process of 
file input/output (or &#8220;I/O&#8221;) may go wrong for some reason 
to do with the host computer: for instance, if it runs out of disc 
space. Such errors are rare and look like this:</p>

<p><tt>I/O failure: couldn't read from source file<br>
I/O failure: couldn't backtrack on story file for checksum</tt></p>

<p class="normal">and so forth. The explanation might be that two 
tasks are vying for control of the same file (e.g., two independent Inform 
compilations trying to write a debugging information file with the 
same name), or that the file has somehow been left &#8220;open&#8221; 
by earlier, aborted compilation. Normally you can only have at most 
256 files of source code in a single compilation. If this limit is 
passed, Inform generates the error</p>

<p><tt>Program contains too many source files: increase #define MAX_SOURCE_FILES</tt></p>

<p class="normal">This might happen if file <i>A</i> includes file 
<i>B</i> which includes file <i>C</i> which includes file <i>A</i> 
which&#8230; and so on. Finally, if a non-existent pathname variable 
is set in ICL, the error</p>

<p><tt>No such path setting as</tt> &#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">is generated.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>3. <i>Running out of things</i></h4>

<p class="normal">If there is not enough memory even to get started, 
the following appear:</p>

<p><tt>Run out of memory allocating </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">n</span>&#8250;<tt>
bytes for </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">something</span>&#8250;<br>
<tt>Run out of memory allocating array of </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">n</span>&#8250;<tt>x</tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">m</span>&#8250;<tt> bytes for </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">something</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">More often memory will run out in the course of 
compilation, like so:</p>

<p><tt>The memory setting </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">setting</span>&#8250;<tt> 
(which is </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">value</span>&#8250;<tt> at 
present) has been exceeded. Try running Inform again 
with $</tt>&#8249;<span class="token">setting</span>&#8250;<tt>=</tt>&#8249;<span 
class="token">larger-value</span>&#8250;<tt> on the command line.</tt></p>

<p class="normal">(For details of memory settings, see 
<a href="s39.html">&#167;39</a> above.) In a really colossal game, 
it is just conceivable that you might hit</p>

<p><tt>One of the memory blocks has exceeded 640K</tt></p>

<p class="normal">which would need Inform to be recompiled to get 
around (but I do not expect anyone ever to have this trouble, because 
other limits would be reached first). Much more likely is the error</p>

<p><tt>The story file/module exceeds version </tt>&#8249;<span 
class="token">n</span>&#8250;<tt> limit (</tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">m</span>&#8250;<tt>K) by </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">b</span>&#8250;<tt> bytes</tt></p>

<p class="normal">If you're already using version 8, then the story file 
is full: you might be able to squeeze more game in using the <code>Abbreviate</code> 
directive, but basically you're near to the maximum game size possible. 
Otherwise, the error suggests that you might want to change the version 
from 5 to 8, and the game will be able to grow at least twice as large 
again. It's also possible to run out not of story file space but of 
byte-accessible memory:</p>

<p><tt>This program has overflowed the maximum readable-memory size 
of the Z-machine format. See the memory map below: the start of the
area marked &quot;above readable memory&quot; must be brought down 
to $10000 or less.</tt></p>

<a id="p302" name="p302"></a>
<p class="normal">Inform then prints out a memory map so that you can 
see what contributed to the exhaustion: there is detailed advice on 
this vexatious error in <a href="s45.html">&#167;45</a>. Finally,
you can also exhaust the number of classes:</p>

<p><tt>Inform's maximum possible number of classes (whatever amount 
of memory is allocated) has been reached. If this causes serious
inconvenience, please contact the author.</tt></p>

<p class="normal">At time of writing, this maximum is 256 and nobody 
has yet contacted the author.</p>

<h3>Errors</h3>

<p class="normal">In the following, anything in double-quotes is a 
quotation from your source code; other strings are in single-quotes. 
The most common error by far takes the form:</p>

<p><tt>Expected </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">...</span>&#8250;<tt> but
found </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">...</span>&#8250;</p> 

<p class="normal">There are 112 such errors, most of them straightforward 
to sort out, but a few take some practice. One of the trickiest things 
to diagnose is a loop statement having been misspelt. For example, the 
lines</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
pritn &quot;Hello&quot;;
While (x == y) print &quot;x is still y^&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">produce one error each:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
line 1: Error: Expected assignment or statement but found pritn
line 2: Error: Expected ';' but found print
</pre>

<p class="normal">The first is fine. The second is odd: a human immediately 
sees that <code>While</code> is meant to be a <code>while</code> loop, 
but Inform is not able to make textual guesses like this. Instead Inform 
decides that the code intended was</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">While (x == y); print &quot;x is still y^&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">with <code>While</code> assumed to be the name of 
a function which hasn't been declared yet. Thus, Inform thinks the 
mistake is that the <code>;</code> has been missed out.</p>

<p class="indent">In that example, Inform repaired the situation and 
was able to carry on as normal in subsequent lines. But it sometimes happens 
that a whole cascade of errors is thrown up, in code which the user is 
fairly sure must be nearly right. What has happened is that one syntax 
mistake threw Inform off the right track, so that it continued not 
to know where it was for many lines in a row. Look at the first error 
message, fix that and then try again.</p>

<h4>1. <i>Reading in the source-code</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>Unrecognised combination in source: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">text</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Alphabetic character expected after </tt>&#8249;<span

<li><tt>Expected 'p' after '//' to give number of dictionary word </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">word</span>&#8250;</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">In that last error message, &#8220;number&#8221; is 
used in the linguistic sense, of singular versus plural.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>2. <i>Characters</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>Illegal character found in source: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>No such accented character as </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">text</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>'@{' without matching '}'</tt></li>
<li><tt>At most four hexadecimal digits allowed in '@{...}'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'@{...}' may only contain hexadecimal digits</tt></li>
<li><tt>'@..' must have two decimal digits</tt></li>
<li><tt>Character can be printed but not input: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Character can be printed but not used as a value: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Alphabet string must give exactly 23 [or 26] characters</tt></li>
<li><tt>Character can't be used in alphabets unless entered into Zcharacter
 table: </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Character must first be entered into Zcharacter table: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Character can only be used if declared in advance as part of 'Zcharacter 
table': </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Character duplicated in alphabet: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">char</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>No more room in the Zcharacter table</tt></li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">Characters are given by ISO Latin-1 code number if 
in this set, and otherwise by Unicode number, and are also printed if 
this is possible. For instance, if you try to use an accented character 
as part of an identifier name, you cause an error like so:</p>

<p><tt>Error: Illegal character found in source: (ISO Latin1) $e9, 
i.e., 'e'<br>&gt; Object cafe</tt></p>

<a id="p304" name="p304"></a>
<p class="normal">because identifiers may only use the letters A to Z, 
in upper and lower case, the digits 0 to 9 and the underscore character 
_. The same kind of error is produced if you try to use (say) the ^ 
character outside of quotation marks. The characters legal in unquoted 
Inform source code are:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8249;<span class="token">new-line</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">form-feed</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">space</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">tab</span>&#8250;<br>
<tt>0123456789<br>
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<br>
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>
()[]{}&lt;&gt;&quot;',.:;?!+-*/%=&amp;|~#@_</tt></p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>3. <i>Variables and arrays</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>Variable must be defined before use: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>'=' applied to undeclared variable</tt></li>
<li><tt>Local variable defined twice: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>All 233 global variables already declared</tt></li>
<li><tt>No array size or initial values given</tt></li>
<li><tt>Array sizes must be known now, not externally defined</tt></li>
<li><tt>An array must have a positive number of entries</tt></li>
<li><tt>A 'string' array can have at most 256 entries</tt></li>
<li><tt>An array must have between 1 and 32767 entries</tt></li>
<li><tt>Entries in byte arrays and strings must be known constants</tt></li>
<li><tt>Missing ';' to end the initial array values before &quot;[&quot; or &quot;]&quot;</tt></li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">The limit of 233 global variables is absolute: a 
program even approaching this limit should probably be making more 
use of object properties to store its information. &#8220;Entries&#8230;
must be known constants&#8221; is a restriction on what byte or 
string arrays may contain: basically, numbers or characters; defined
constants (such as object names) may only be used if they have already 
been defined. This restriction does not apply to the more normally used 
word and table arrays.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>4. <i>Routines and function calls</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>No 'Main' routine has been defined</tt></li>
<li><tt>It is illegal to nest routines using '#['</tt></li>
<li><tt>A routine can have at most 15 local variables</tt></li>
<li><tt>Argument to system function missing</tt></li>
<li><tt>System function given with too many arguments</tt></li>
<li><tt>Only constants can be used as possible 'random' results</tt></li>
<li><tt><a id="p305" name="305"></a>A function may be called with at most 7 arguments</tt></li>
<li><tt>Duplicate definition of label: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>The following name is reserved by Inform for its own use as a
routine name; you can use it as a routine name yourself (to 
override the standard definition) but cannot use it for anything 
else: </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">Note that the system function <code>random</code>, when 
it takes more than one argument, can only take constant arguments, 
as this enables the possibilities to be stored efficiently within 
the program. Thus <code>random(random(10), location)</code> will
produce an error. To make a random choice between non-constant values,
write a <code>switch</code> statement instead.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>5. <i>Expressions and arithmetic</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>Missing operator: inserting '+'</tt></li>
<li><tt>Evaluating this has no effect: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">operator</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>'=' applied to </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">operator</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Brackets mandatory to clarify order of: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">operator</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Missing operand for </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">operator</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Missing operand after </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">something</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Found '(' without matching ')'</tt></li>
<li><tt>No expression between brackets '(' and ')'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'or' not between values to the right of a condition</tt></li>
<li><tt>'has'/'hasnt' applied to illegal attribute number</tt></li>
<li><tt>Division of constant by zero</tt></li>
<li><tt>Signed arithmetic on compile-time constants overflowed the range
 -32768 to +32767: </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">calculation</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Label name used as value: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>System function name used as value: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>No such constant as </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>The obsolete '#w$word' construct has been removed</tt></li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">&#8220;Operators&#8221; include not only addition 
<code>+</code>, multiplication <code>*</code> and so on, but also
higher-level things like <code>--&gt;</code> (&#8220;array entry&#8221;) 
and <code>.</code> (&#8220;property value&#8221;) and <code>::</code>
(&#8220;superclass&#8221;). An example of an operator where &#8220;Evaluating 
this has no effect&#8221; is in the statement</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">34 * score;</pre>

<p class="normal">where the multiplication is a waste of time, since 
nothing is done with the result. &#8220;= applied to &#8249;<span
class="token">operator</span>&#8250;&#8221; means something like</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">(4 / fish) = 7;</pre>

<a id="p306" name="p306"></a>
<p class="normal">which literally means &#8220;set 4<code>/fish</code> to 7&#8221; 
and gives the error &#8220;= applied to /&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">&#8220;Brackets mandatory to clarify order&#8221; means 
that an expression is unclear as written, and this is often a caution 
that it would be wrong either way and needs to be reconsidered. For 
instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (parent(axe) == location == Hall_of_Mists) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">This looks as if it might mean &#8220;if these three 
values are all equal&#8221;, but does not: the result of <code>==</code> is 
either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, so whichever comparison happens
first, the other one compares against one of these values.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>6. <i>Miscellaneous errors in statements</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>'do' without matching 'until'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'default' without matching 'switch'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'else' without matching 'if'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'until' without matching 'do'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'break' can only be used in a loop or 'switch' block</tt></li>
<li><tt>At most 32 values can be given in a single 'switch' case</tt></li>
<li><tt>Multiple 'default' clauses defined in same 'switch'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'default' must be the last 'switch' case</tt></li>
<li><tt>'continue' can only be used in a loop block</tt></li>
<li><tt>A reserved word was used as a print specification: </tt>&#8249;<span
 class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>No lines of text given for 'box' display</tt></li>
<li><tt>In Version 3 no status-line drawing routine can be given</tt></li>
<li><tt>The 'style' statement cannot be used for Version 3 games</tt></li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">For instance, <code>print (bold) X</code> gives the 
&#8220;reserved word in print specification&#8221; error because <code>bold</code> 
is a keyword that has some meaning already (the statement <code>style 
bold;</code> changes the type face to bold). Anyway, call such a printing
routine something else.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>7. <i>Object and class declarations</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>Two textual short names given for only one object</tt></li>
<li><tt>The syntax '-&gt;' is only used as an alternative to 'Nearby'</tt></li>
<li><tt>Use of '-&gt;' (or 'Nearby') clashes with giving a parent</tt></li>
<li><tt>'-&gt;' (or 'Nearby') fails because there is no previous object</tt></li>
<li><tt>'-&gt; -&gt; ...' fails because no previous object is deep enough</tt></li>
<li><tt>Two commas ',' in a row in object/class definition</tt></li>
<li><tt>Object/class definition finishes with ','</tt></li>

<li><tt>Property given twice in the same declaration, because the names
'</tt>&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<tt>' and '</tt>&#8249;<span

<li><tt>Property should be declared in 'with', not 'private': </tt>&#8249;<span

<li><tt>Limit (of 32 values) exceeded for property </tt>&#8249;<span
class="tokne">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>An additive property has inherited so many values that the

<li><tt>Duplicate-number not known at compile time</tt></li>
<li><tt>The number of duplicates must be 1 to 10000</tt></li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">Note that &#8220;common properties&#8221; (those provided 
by the library, or those declared with <code>Property</code>) cannot 
be made <code>private</code>. All other properties arecalled &#8220;individual&#8221;. 
The &#8220;number of duplicates&#8221; referred to is the number of duplicate 
instances to make for a new class, and it needs to be a number Inform 
can determine now, not later on in the source code (or in another module 
altogether). The limit 10,000 is arbitrary and imposed to help prevent
accidents: in practice available memory is very unlikely to permit 
anything like this many instances.</p>

<h4>8. <i>Grammar</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>Two different verb definitions refer to </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>There is no previous grammar for the verb </tt>&#8249;<span

<li><tt>This is a fake action, not a real one: </tt>&#8249;<span
class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>Too many lines of grammar for verb: increase #define MAX_LINES_PER_VERB</tt></li>
<li><tt>'/' can only be used with Library 6/3 or later</tt></li>
<li><tt>'/' can only be applied to prepositions</tt></li>
<li><tt>The 'topic' token is only available if you are using Library
6/3 or later</tt></li>
<li><tt>'reverse' actions can only be used with Library 6/3 or later</tt></li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">At present verbs are limited to 20 grammar lines each, 
though this would be easy to increase. (A grammar of this kind of 
length can probably be written more efficiently using general parsing

<h4>13. <i>Deliberate &#8220;errors&#8221;</i></h4>

<p class="normal">Finally, error messages can also be produced from 
within the program (deliberately) using <code>Message</code>. It may 
be that a mysterious message is being caused by an included file 
written by someone other than yourself.</p>

<h3>Warnings</h3>

<h4>1. <i>Questionable practices</i></h4>

<p>&#8249;<span class="token">type</span>&#8250;
&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;<tt> declared but not used</tt></p>

<p class="normal">For example, a <code>Global</code> directive was 
used to create a variable, which was then never used in the program.</p>

<p><tt>'=' used as condition: '==' intended?</tt></p>

<p class="normal">Although a line like</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (x = 5) print &quot;My name is Alan Partridge.&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">is legal, it's probably a mistake: <code>x = 5</code> 
sets <code>x</code> to 5 and results in 5, so the condition is always 
true. Presumably it was a mistype for <code>x == 5</code> meaning 
&#8220;test <code>x</code> to see if it's equal to 5&#8221;.</p>

<p><tt>Unlike C, Inform uses ':' to divide parts of a 'for' loop
specification: replacing ';' with ':'</tt></p>

<p class="normal">Programmers used to the C language will now and then 
habitually type a <code>for</code> loop in the form</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">but Inform needs colons, not semicolons: however, as 
it can see what was intended, it makes the correction automatically 
and issues only a warning.</p>

<a id="p311" name="p311"></a>
<p><tt>Missing ','? Property data seems to contain the property 
name </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">The following, part of an object declaration, 
is legal but unlikely:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
with found_in MarbleHall
     short_name &quot;conch shell&quot;, name &quot;conch&quot; &quot;shell&quot;,
</pre>

<p class="normal">As written, the <code>found_in</code> property has 
a list of three values: <code>MarbleHall</code>, <code>short_name</code> 
and <code>&quot;conch shell&quot;</code>. <code>short_name</code> 
throws up the warning because Inform suspects that a comma was missed 
out and the programmer intended</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
with found_in MarbleHall,
     short_name &quot;conch shell&quot;, name &quot;conch&quot; &quot;shell&quot;,
</pre>

<p><tt>This is not a declared Attribute: </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">Similarly, suppose that a game contains a pen. Then 
the following <code>give</code> statement is dubious but legal:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">give MarbleDoorway pen;</pre>

<p class="normal">The warning is caused because it's far more likely 
to be a misprint for</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">give MarbleDoorway open;</pre>

<p><tt>Without bracketing, the minus sign '-' is ambiguous</tt></p>

<p class="normal">For example,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Array Doubtful --&gt; 50 10 -20 56;</pre>

<p class="normal">because Inform is not sure whether this contains three 
entries (the middle one being 10 &#8722; 20 = &#8722;10), or four. 
It guesses four, but suggests brackets to clarify the situation.</p>

<p><tt>Entry in '-&gt;' or 'string' array not in range 0 to 255</tt></p>

<p class="normal">Byte <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>string</code> 
arrays can only hold numbers in the range 0 to 255. If a larger entry 
is supplied, only the remainder mod 256 is stored, and this warning 
is issued.</p>

<a id="p312" name="p312"></a>
<p><tt>This statement can never be reached</tt></p>

<p class="normal">There is no way that the statement being compiled 
can ever be executed when the game is played. Here is an obvious example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">return; print &quot;Goodbye!&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">where the <code>print</code> statement can never be 
reached, because a <code>return</code> must just have happened. 
Beginners often run into this example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">&quot;You pick up the gauntlet.&quot;; score = score + 5; return;</pre>

<p class="normal">Here the <code>score = score + 5</code> statement 
is never reached because the text, given on its own, means &#8220;print 
this, then print a new-line, then return from the current routine&#8221;. 
The intended behaviour needs something like</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">score = score + 5; &quot;You pick up the gauntlet.&quot;;</pre>

<p><tt>Verb disagrees with previous verbs: </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">verb</span>&#8250;</p>

<p class="normal">The <code>Extend only</code> directive is used to 
cleave off a set of synonymous English verbs and make them into a new 
Inform verb. For instance, ordinarily &#8220;take&#8221;, &#8220;get&#8221;, 
&#8220;carry&#8221; and &#8220;hold&#8221; are one single Inform verb, 
but this directive could split off &#8220;carry&#8221; and &#8220;get&#8221; 
from the other two. The warning would arise if one tried to split off 
&#8220;take&#8221; and &#8220;drop&#8221; together, which come from 
different original Inform verbs. (It's still conceivably usable, which 
is why it's a warning, not an error.)</p>

<p><tt>This does not set the final game's statusline</tt></p>

<p class="normal">An attempt to choose, e.g., <code>Statusline time</code> 
within a module, having no effect on the program into which the module 
will one day be linked. Futile. Finally a ragbag of unlikely and fairly 
self-explanatory contingencies:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>This version of Inform is unable to produce the grammar table 
format requested (producing number 2 format instead)</tt></li>
<li><tt>Grammar line cut short: you can only have up to 6 tokens in 
any line (unless you're compiling with library 6/3 or later)</tt></li>
<li><tt>Version 3 limit of 4 values per property exceeded (use -v5 
to get 32), so truncating property </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">name</span>&#8250;</li>
<li><tt>The 'box' statement has no effect in a version 3 game</tt></li>
<li><tt>Module has a more advanced format than this release of the
Inform 6 compiler knows about: it may not link in correctly</tt></li>
</ul>

<a id="p313" name="p313"></a>
<p class="normal">The last of these messages is to allow for different 
module formats to be introduced in future releases of Inform, but 
so far there has only ever been module format 1, so nobody has ever 
produced this error.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h4>2. <i>Obsolete usages</i></h4>

<ul>
<li><tt>more modern to use 'Array', not 'Global'</tt></li>
<li><tt>use '-&gt;' instead of 'data'</tt></li>
<li><tt>use '-&gt;' instead of 'initial'</tt></li>
<li><tt>use '-&gt;' instead of 'initstr'</tt></li>
<li><tt>ignoring 'print_paddr': use 'print (string)' instead</tt></li>
<li><tt>ignoring 'print_addr': use 'print (address)' instead</tt></li>
<li><tt>ignoring 'print_char': use 'print (char)' instead</tt></li>
<li><tt>use 'word' as a constant dictionary address</tt></li>
<li><tt>'#a$Act' is now superseded by '##Act'</tt></li>
<li><tt>'#n$word' is now superseded by ''word''</tt></li>
<li><tt>'#r$Routine' can now be written just 'Routine'</tt></li>
<li><tt>all properties are now automatically 'long'</tt></li>
<li><tt>use the ^ character for the apostrophe in </tt>&#8249;<span class="token">dictionary word</span>&#8250;</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">These all occur if Inform compiles a syntax which 
was correct under Inform 5 (or earlier) but has now been withdrawn 
in favour of something better.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
No Inform library file (or any other file marked <code>System_file</code>) 
produces warning messages. It may contain many declared but unused 
routines, or may contain obsolete usages for the sake of backward 
compatibility.</p>

<P>

A slight refinement of such a "purloin'' verb is already defined
in the library (if the constant <TT>DEBUG</TT> is defined), so there's no need.
But here's how it could be done:
<PRE>
[ Anything i;
  if (scope_stage==1) rfalse;
  if (scope_stage==2)
  {   objectloop (i ofclass Object) PlaceInScope(i); rtrue; }
  "No such in game.";
];
</PRE>

(This disallows multiple matches for efficiency reasons -- the parser has
enough work to do with such a huge scope definition as it is.)  Now
the token <TT>scope=Anything</TT> will match anything at all, even things like
the abstract concept of 'east'.

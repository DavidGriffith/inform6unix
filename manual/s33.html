<h2>§33 &nbsp; Helping the parser out of trouble</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-247_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Once you begin programming the parser on a large scale, you soon reach 
the point where the parser's ordinary error messages no longer
appear sensible. The <code>ParserError</code> entry point can change the 
rules even at this last hurdle: it takes one argument, the error type, 
and should return <code>true</code> to tell the parser to shut up, 
because a better error message has already been printed, or <code>false</code>, 
to tell the parser to print its usual message.
The error types are defined as constants:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td><code>STUCK_PE</code></td>
 <td>I didn't understand that sentence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>UPTO_PE</code></td>
 <td>I only understood you as far as&#8230;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NUMBER_PE</code></td>
 <td>I didn't understand that number.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>CANTSEE_PE</code></td>
 <td>You can't see any such thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TOOLIT_PE</code></td>
 <td>You seem to have said too little!</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NOTHELD_PE</code></td>
 <td>You aren't holding that!</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>MULTI_PE</code></td>
 <td>You can't use multiple objects with that verb.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>MMULTI_PE</code></td>
 <td>You can only use multiple objects once on a line.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>VAGUE_PE</code></td>
 <td>I'm not sure what &#8216;it&#8217; refers to.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>EXCEPT_PE</code></td>
 <td>You excepted something not included anyway!</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ANIMA_PE</code></td>
 <td>You can only do that to something animate.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>VERB_PE</code></td>
 <td>That's not a verb I recognise.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>SCENERY_PE</code></td>
 <td>That's not something you need to refer to&#8230;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ITGONE_PE</code></td>
 <td>You can't see &#8216;it&#8217; (the <em>whatever</em>) at the moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>JUNKAFTER_PE</code></td>
 <td>I didn't understand the way that finished.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TOOFEW_PE</code></td>
 <td>Only five of those are available.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NOTHING_PE</code></td>
 <td>Nothing to do!</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ASKSCOPE_PE</code></td>
 <td><em>whatever the scope routine prints</em></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">Each unsuccessful grammar line ends in one of these conditions. 
By the time the parser wants to print an error, every one of the 
grammar lines in a verb will have failed. The error message chosen 
it prints is the most &#8220;interesting&#8221; one: meaning, 
lowest down this list.</p>

<p class="indent">If a general parsing routine you have written returns 
<code>GPR_FAIL</code>, then the grammar line containing it normally ends in 
plain <code>STUCK_PE</code>, the least interesting of all errors (unless 
you did something like calling the library's <code>ParseToken</code> 
routine before giving up, which might have set a more interesting
error like <code>CANTSEE_PE</code>). But you can choose to create a new 
error and put it in the parser's variable <code>etype</code>, 
as in the following example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ Degrees d;
  d = TryNumber(wn++);<a id="p248" name="p248"></a>
  if (d == -1000) return GPR_FAIL;
  if (d &lt;= 360) { parsed_number = d; return GPR_NUMBER; }
  etype = &quot;There are only 360 degrees in a circle.&quot;;
  return GPR_FAIL;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">This parses a number of degrees between 0 and 360. 
Although etype normally only holds values like <code>VERB_PE</code>, 
which are numbers lower than 100, here we've set it equal to a string. 
As this will be a value that the parser doesn't recognise, we need to 
write a <code>ParserError</code> routine that will take care of it, 
by reacting to a string in the obvious way &#8211; printing it out.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ ParserError error_type;
  if (error_type ofclass String) print_ret (string) error_type;
  rfalse;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">This will result in conversation like so:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>steer down</tt><br>
I didn't understand that sentence.<br>
&gt;<tt>steer 385</tt><br>
There are only 360 degrees in a circle.</p>

<p class="normal">In the first case, <code>Degrees</code> failed without 
setting any special error message on finding that the second word 
wasn't a number; in the second case it gave the new, specific error 
message.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The <code>VAGUE_PE</code> and <code>ITGONE_PE</code> 
errors apply to all pronouns (in English, &#8220;it&#8221;, &#8220;him&#8221;, 
&#8220;her&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;). The variable <code>vague_word</code> 
contains the dictionary address of whichever pronoun is involved 
(<code>'it'</code>, <code>'him'</code> and so on).</p>

<p class="indent">You can find out the current setting of a pronoun 
using the library's <code>PronounValue</code> routine: for instance, 
<code>PronounValue('it')</code> 
gives the object which &#8220;it&#8221; currently refers to, possibly 
nothing. Similarly <code>SetPronoun('it', magic_ruby)</code> 
would set &#8220;it&#8221; to mean the magic ruby object. You might 
want this because, when something like a magic ruby suddenly appears 
in the middle of a turn, players will habitually call it &#8220;it&#8221;. 
A better way to adjust the pronouns is to call 
<code>PronounNotice(magic_ruby)</code>, which sets whatever pronouns 
are appropriate. That is, it works out if the object is a thing or
a person, of what number and gender, which pronouns apply to it in the
parser's current language, and so on. In code predating Inform 6.1 
you may see variables called <code>itobj</code>, <code>himobj</code> 
and <code>herobj</code> holding the English pronoun values: these still 
work properly, but please use the modern system in new games.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The Inform parser resolves ambiguous object names with a pragmatic 
algorithm which has evolved over the years (see below). Experience 
also shows that no two people ever quite agree on what the parser 
should &#8220;naturally&#8221; do. Designers have an opportunity 
to influence this by providing an entry point routine called 
<code>ChooseObjects</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">ChooseObjects(obj, code)</pre>

<p class="aside">is called in two circumstances. If <code>code</code> is <code>false</code> 
or <code>true</code>, the parser is considering including the given 
<code>obj</code> in an &#8220;all&#8221;: <code>false</code> means 
the parser has decided against, <code>true</code> means it has decided 
in favour. The routine should reply</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>&nbsp; to accept the parser's decision;</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>&nbsp; to force the object to be included; or</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>&nbsp; to force the object to be excluded.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="aside">It may want to decide using <code>verb_word</code> (the 
variable storing the current verb word, e.g., <code>'take'</code>) 
and <code>action_to_be</code>, which is the action which would happen 
if the current line of grammar were successfully matched.</p>

<p class="aside">The other circumstance is when <code>code</code> is 
2. This means the parser is choosing between a list of items which 
made equally good matches against some text, and would like a hint. 
<code>ChooseObjects</code> should then return a number from 0 to 9 to 
give <code>obj</code> a score for how appropriate it is.</p>

<p class="aside">For instance, some designers would prefer &#8220;take 
all&#8221; not to attempt to take <code>scenery</code> objects (which 
Inform, and the parsers in most of the Infocom games, will do). 
Let us code this, and also teach the parser that edible things are 
more likely to be eaten than inedible ones:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ ChooseObjects obj code;
  if (code &lt; 2) { if (obj has scenery) return 2; rfalse; }
  if (action_to_be == ##Eat &amp;&amp; obj has edible) return 3;
  if (obj hasnt scenery) return 2;
  return 1;
];
</pre>

<p class="aside">Scenery is now excluded from &#8220;all&#8221; lists; 
and is further penalised in that non-scenery objects are always 
preferred over scenery, all else being equal. Most objects score 2 
but edible things in the context of eating score 3, so &#8220;eat 
black&#8221; will now always choose a Black Forest gateau in preference 
to a black rod with a rusty iron star on the end.</p>

Allow &#8220;lock&#8221; and &#8220;unlock&#8221; to infer their second 
objects without being told, if there's an obvious choice (because the 
player's only carrying one key), but to issue a disambiguation question 
otherwise. (Use <code>Extend</code>, not <code>ChooseObjects</code>.)</p>

Joyce Haslam's Inform edition of the classic Acornsoft game &#8216;Gateway 
to Karos&#8217; requires a class called <code>FaintlyLitRoom</code> 
for rooms so dimly illuminated that &#8220;take all&#8221; is impossible. 
How might this work?</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Suppose we have a set of objects which have all matched equally well 
against the textual input, so that some knowledge of the game world 
is needed to resolve which of the objects &#8211; possibly only one, 
possibly more &#8211; is or are intended. Deciding this is called 
&#8220;disambiguation&#8221;, and here in full are the rules used 
by library 6/10 to do it. The reader is cautioned that after six years, 
these rules are still evolving.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table style="text-align:justify">
<tr><td valign="top" width="30px" style="text-align:right">(1)</td>
<td>Call an object &#8220;good&#8221; according to a rule depending 
on what kind of token is being matched:

 <tr><td valign="top"><span class="grammartoken"><code>held</code></span></td>
  <td>Good if its parent is the actor.</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><span class="grammartoken"><code>multiheld</code></span></td>
  <td>Good if its parent is the actor.</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><span class="grammartoken"><code>multiexcept</code></span></td>

 <tr><td valign="top"><span class="grammartoken"><code>multiinside</code></span></td>
  <td>Good if not inside the second object, if that's known yet.</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><span class="grammartoken"><code>creature</code></span></td>
  <td>Good if <code>animate</code>, or if the proposed action is 
  <code>Ask</code>, <code>Answer</code>, <code>Tell</code> or 
  <code>AskFor</code> and the object is <code>talkable</code>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><i>other tokens</i></td>
  <td>All objects are good.</td></tr>
 </table>
 If only a single object is good, this is immediately chosen.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" width="30px" style="text-align:right">(2)</td>
<td>If the token is <span class="grammartoken"><code>creature</code></span> 
and no objects are good, fail the token altogether, as no choice can 
make sense.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" width="30px" style="text-align:right">(3)</td>
<td>Objects which don't fit &#8220;descriptors&#8221; used by the 
player are removed:
 <table cellspacing="0" style="margin-left:30px">
 <tr><td>if &#8220;my&#8221;, an object whose parent isn't the actor 
 is discarded;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>if &#8220;that&#8221;, an object whose parent isn't the actor's 
 location is discarded;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>if &#8220;lit&#8221;, an object which hasn't <code>light</code>

 <tr><td>if &#8220;unlit&#8221;, an object which has <code>light</code> 
 is discarded;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>if &#8220;his&#8221; or some similar possessive pronoun, an 
 object not owned by the person implied is discarded.</td></tr>
 </table>
Thus &#8220;his lit torches&#8221; will invoke two of these rules 
at once.</td></tr>

make sense.</td></tr>

  <i>C</i> = 0.)</li>

 (Recall that &#8220;visibility ceiling&#8221; usually means &#8220;location&#8221;

 directions.) The values <i>A</i> and <i>L</i> depend on the token

 <li>10 points for not having <code>scenery</code>.</li>
 <li>5 points for not being the actor object.</li>
 <li>1 point if the object's gender, number and animation (GNA) matches 
 one possibility implied by some pronoun typed by the player: for 
 instance &#8220;them&#8221; in English implying plural, or &#8220;le&#8221; 
 in French implying masculine singular.</li>
 </ol></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" width="30px" style="text-align:right">(6d)</td>
<td>In &#8220;definite mode&#8221;, such as if the player has typed

highest score, choose that object.</td></tr>

player has typed something definitely implying a plural, such 
as the words &#8220;all&#8221; or &#8220;three&#8221; or &#8220;coins&#8221;. 
Here the parser already has a target number of objects to choose:
for instance 3 for &#8220;three&#8221;, or the special value of 100, 
meaning &#8220;an unlimited number&#8221;, for &#8220;all&#8221; 
or &#8220;coins&#8221;.<br>Go through the list of objects in &#8220;best

unless:

 <li>it has <code>worn</code> or <code>concealed</code>;</li>
 <li>or the action is Take or Remove and the object is held by the actor;</li>
 <li>or the token is <span class="grammartoken"><code>multiheld</code></span> 
 or <span class="grammartoken"><code>multiexcept</code></span> and the 
 object isn't held by the actor;</li>
 <li>or the target number is &#8220;unlimited&#8221; and <i>S</i>/20 
 (rounded down to the nearest integer) has fallen below its maximum value, 
 where <i>S</i> is the score of the object.</li>
 </ol>
 The entry point <code>ChooseObjects(object,accept_flag)</code> is 
 now called and can overrule the &#8220;accept&#8221;/&#8220;reject&#8221;

 target is reached, or proves impossible to reach.</td></tr>

objects forms a single group. &#8220;Indistinguishable&#8221; means 
that no further text typed by the player could clarify which is meant 
(see <a href="s29.html">§29</a>). Note that there is no reason to 
suppose that two indistinguishable objects have the same score, because 
they might be in different places.</td></tr>

You can see a bronze coin and four gold coins here.<br>
&gt;<tt>get coin</tt><br>
Which do you mean, the bronze coin or a gold coin?<br>
&gt;<tt>gold</tt><br><br>
The player's response is inserted textually into the original input

belong to the same group. Either way, choose the &#8220;best guess&#8221; 
object (see below). Should this parsing attempt eventually prove
successful, print up an &#8220;inference&#8221; on screen, such as<br><br>

objects have equal highest scores, it is the earliest one to have been 
matched by the parser. In practice this means the one most recently 
taken or dropped, because the parser tries to match against objects 
by traversing the object-tree, and the most recently moved object
tends to be the first in the list of children of its parent.</td></tr>

<h2>&#167;36 &nbsp; Parsing non-English languages</h2>

<blockquote><em>It</em>, hell. She had <em>Those</em>.<br>
&#8212; Dorothy Parker (1893&#8211;1967), reviewing the romantic novel 
&#8216;<i>It</i>&#8217;</blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-267_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Before embarking on a new language definition file, the translator
may want to consider what compromises are worth making, omitting tricky 
but not really necessary features of the language. For instance, 
in German, adjectives take forms agreeing with whether their noun takes 
a definite or indefinite article:</p>

<p class="syntax">ein gro&#223;er Mann &nbsp; <i>a tall man</i> (German)<br>
der gro&#223;e Mann &nbsp; <i>the tall man</i></p>

<p class="normal">This is an essential. But German also has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; 
form for adjectives, used in sentences like</p>

<p class="syntax">Der Mann ist gro&#223; &nbsp; <i>The man is tall</i></p>

<p class="normal">Now it could be argued that if the parser asks the 
German equivalent of</p>

<p class="output">Whom do you mean, the tall man or the short man?</p>

<p class="normal">then the player ought to be able to reply &#8220;gro&#223;&#8221;. 
But this is probably not worth the effort.</p>

<p class="indent">As another example from German, is it essential for 
the parser to recognise commands put in the polite form when addressed 
to somebody other than the player? For instance,</p>

<p class="syntax">freddy, &ouml;ffne den ofen &nbsp;
<i>Freddy, open the oven</i><br>
herr kr&uuml;ger, &ouml;ffnen sie den ofen &nbsp;
<i>Mr Krueger, open the oven</i></p>

<p class="normal">indicate that Freddy is a friend but Mr Krueger a 
mere acquaintance. A translator might go to the trouble of implementing 
this, but equally might not bother, and simply tell players always to 
use the familiar form. It's harder to avoid the issue of whether the 
computer is familiar to the player. Does the player address the computer 
or the main character of the game? In English it makes no difference, 
but there are languages where an imperative verb agrees 
<a id="p268" name="p268"></a>
with the gender of the person being addressed. Is the computer male? Is it 
still male if the game's main character is female?</p>

<p class="indent">Another choice is whether to require the player to 
use letters other than &#8216;a&#8217; to &#8216;z&#8217; from the 
keyboard. French readers are used to seeing words written in capital 
letters without accents, so that there is no need to make the player
type accents. In Finnish, though, &#8216;&auml;&#8217; and 
&#8216;&ouml;&#8217; are significantly different from &#8216;a&#8217;
and &#8216;o&#8217;: &#8220;vaara&#8221; means &#8220;danger&#8221;, 
but &#8220;v&auml;&auml;r&auml;&#8221; means &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, there are also dialect forms. The number 80 
is &#8220;quatre-vingt&#8221; in metropolitan French, &#8220;octante&#8221; 
in Belgian and &#8220;huitante&#8221; in Swiss French. In such cases, 
the translator may want to write the language definition file to
cope with all possible dialects. For example, something like</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
#ifdef DIALECT_FRANCOPHONE; print &quot;septante&quot;;
#ifnot; print &quot;soixante-dix&quot;;
#endif;
</pre>

<p class="normal">would enable the same definition file to be used by 
Belgian authors and members of the Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise 
alike. The standard <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> definition
already has such a constant: <code>DIALECT_US</code>, which uses American 
spellings, so that if an Inform game defines</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant DIALECT_US;</pre>

<p class="normal">before including <code>Parser</code>, then (for 
example) the number 106 would be printed in words as &#8220;one 
hundred six&#8221; instead of &#8220;one hundred and six&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
An alternative is to allow the player to change dialect during play, 
and to encode all spelling variations inside variable strings. Ralf 
Herrmann's <tt>&quot;German.h&quot;</tt> does this to allow the 
player to choose traditional, reformed or Swiss German conventions on 
the use of &#8220;&#223;&#8221;. The low string variables <code>@30</code> and <code>@31</code> 
each hold either &#8220;ss&#8221; or &#8220;&#223;&#8221; for use
in words like <code>&quot;schlie@30t&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;mu@31t&quot;</code>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<h3>Organisation of language definition files</h3>

<p class="normal">A language definition file is itself written in 
Inform, and fairly readable Inform at that: you may want to have a 
copy of <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> to refer to while reading the 
rest of this section. This is divided into four parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman;margin-top:0">
<li>Preliminaries</li>
<li>Vocabulary</li>
<li>Translating to Informese</li>
<li>Printing</li>
</ol>

<a id="p269" name="p269"></a>
<p class="normal">It is helpful for all language definitions to 
follow the order and layout style of <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>. 
The example used throughout the rest of the section is of developing a
definition of <tt>&quot;French.h&quot;</tt>.</p>

<h3>(I.1) Version number and alphabet</h3>

<p class="normal">The file should begin as follows:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">

!   Part I.   Preliminaries
! -----------------------------------------------------------
Constant LanguageVersion
    = &quot;Traduction fran@ccais 961205 par Angela M. Horns&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="normal">(<tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> defines a constant called 
<code>EnglishNaturalLanguage</code> here, but this is just to help 
the library keep old code working with the new parser: don't define a 
similar constant yourself.) Note the c-cedilla written using escape 
characters, <code>@cc</code> not <code>&ccedil;</code>, which is a precaution 
to make absolutely certain that the file will be legible on anyone's 
system, even one whose character set doesn't have accented characters 
in the normal way.</p>

<p class="indent">The next ingredient of Part I is declaring the accented 
letters which need to be &#8220;cheap&#8221; in the following sense. 
Inside story files, dictionary words are stored to a &#8220;resolution&#8221; 
of nine Z-characters: that is, only the first nine Z-characters are 
looked at, so that</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8220;chrysanthemum&#8221; &nbsp; is stored as &nbsp;
<code>'chrysanth'</code><br>
&#8220;chrysanthemums&#8221; &nbsp; is stored as &nbsp;
<code>'chrysanth'</code></p>

<p class="normal">(This is one of the reasons why Informese doesn't make 
linguistic use of word-endings.) Normally no problem, but unfortunately 
Z-characters are not the same as letters. The letters &#8216;A&#8217; 
to &#8216;Z&#8217; are &#8220;cheap&#8221; and take only one Z-character 
each, but accented letters like &#8216;&eacute;&#8217; normally 
take out four Z-characters. If your translation is going to ask the 
player to type accented letters at the keyboard (which even a French 
translation need not do: see above), the resolution may be unacceptably 
low:</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8220;t&eacute;l&eacute;carte&#8221; &nbsp;
is stored as &nbsp; <code>'t@'el'</code><br>
&#8220;t&eacute;l&eacute;phone&#8221; &nbsp; is stored as <code>'t@'el'</code></p>

<p class="normal">as there are not even enough of the nine Z-characters 
left to encode the second &#8216;&eacute;&#8217;, let alone the &#8216;c&#8217; 
or the &#8216;p&#8217; which would distinguish the two words. Inform therefore 
<a id="p270" name="p270"></a>
provides a mechanism to make up to about 10 common accents 
cheaper to use, in that they then take only two Z-characters each, not 
four. In the case of French, we might write:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Zcharacter '@'e';   ! E-acute
Zcharacter '@`e';   ! E-grave
Zcharacter '@`a';   ! A-grave
Zcharacter '@`u';   ! U-grave
Zcharacter '@^a';   ! A-circumflex
Zcharacter '@^e';   ! E-circumflex
</pre>

<p class="normal">(Note that since the Z-machine automatically reduces 
anything the player types into lower case, we need only include lower-case 
accented letters here. Note also that there are plenty of other French 
accented letters (&iuml;, &ucirc; and so forth) but these are uncommon
enough not to matter here.) With this change made,</p>

<p class="syntax">&#8220;t&eacute;l&eacute;carte&#8221; &nbsp;
is stored as &nbsp; <code>'t@'el@'ecar'</code><br>
&#8220;t&eacute;l&eacute;phone&#8221; &nbsp; is stored as &nbsp;
<code>'t@'el@'epho'</code></p>

<p class="normal">enabling a phone card and a phone to be correctly 
distinguished by the parser.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
In any story file, 78 of the characters in the ZSCII set are designated 
as &#8220;cheap&#8221; by being placed into what's called the &#8220;alphabet 
table&#8221;. One of these is mandatorily new-line, another is mandatorily 
double-quote and a third cannot be used, leaving 75. <code>Zcharacter</code> 
moves a ZSCII character into the alphabet table, throwing out a character
which hasn't yet been used to make way. Alternatively, and provided 
no characters have so far been used at all, you can write a 
<code>Zcharacter</code> directive which sets the entire alphabet table. 
The form required is to give three strings containing 26, 26 and 23
ZSCII characters respectively. For instance:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Zcharacter &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;
           &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;
           &quot;0123456789!$&amp;*():;.,&lt;&gt;@{386}&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="aside">Characters in alphabet 1, the top row, take only one 
Z-character to print; characters in alphabets 2 and 3 take two Z-characters 
to print; characters not in the table take four. Note that this assumes 
that Unicode <code>$0386</code> (Greek capital Alpha with tonos accent, 
as it happens) is present in ZSCII. Ordinarily it would not be, but 
the block of ZSCII character codes between 155 and 251 is configurable 
and can in principle contain any Unicode characters of your choice. 
By default, if Inform reads ISO 8859-<tt>n</tt> (switch setting <tt>-Cn</tt>) 
then this block is set up to contain all the non-ASCII letter characters 
in ISO 8859-<tt>n</tt>. In the most common case, <tt>-C1</tt> for 
ISO Latin-1, the ligatures &#8216;&oelig;&#8217; and &#8216;&OElig;&#8217;
are then added, but this still leaves 28 character codes vacant.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Zcharacter table + '@{9a}';</pre>

<a id="p271" name="p271"></a>
<p class="aside">adds Unicode character <code>$009a</code>, a copyright 
symbol, to ZSCII. Alternatively, you can instruct Inform to throw 
away all non-standard ZSCII characters and replace them with a fresh 
stock. The effect of:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Zcharacter table '@{9a}' '@{386}' '@^a';</pre>

<p class="aside">is that ZSCII 155 will be a copyright symbol, 156 will 
be a Greek capital alpha with tonos, 157 will be an a-circumflex 
and 158 to 251 will be undefined; and all other accented letters 
will be unavailable. Such <code>Zcharacter</code> directives must 
be made before the characters in question are first used in game 
text. You don't need to know the ZSCII values, anyway: you can always 
write <code>@{9a}</code> when you want a copyright symbol.</p>

<h3>(I.2) Compass objects</h3>

<p class="normal">All that is left in Part I is to declare standard 
compass directions. The corresponding part of <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt>, 
given below, should be imitated as closely as possible:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">

CompassDirection -&gt; s_obj &quot;south wall&quot;
                    with name 's//' 'south' 'wall',    door_dir s_to;

CompassDirection -&gt; in_obj &quot;inside&quot;
                    with                               door_dir in_to;
</pre>

<p class="normal">For example, <tt>&quot;French.h&quot;</tt> would contain:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class  CompassDirection
  with article &quot;le&quot;, number
  has  scenery;
Object Compass &quot;compas&quot; has concealed;
...
CompassDirection -&gt; n_obj &quot;mur nord&quot;
                    with name 'n//' 'nord' 'mur',      door_dir n_to;
</pre>

<h3>(II.1) Informese vocabulary: the small categories</h3>

<p class="normal">This is where small grammatical categories like 
&#8249;<span class="token">again-word</span>&#8250; are defined. 
The following constants must be defined:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<div class="inset"><table>
<tr><td><code>AGAIN*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">again-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>UNDO*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">undo-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>OOPS*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">oops-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>THEN*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">then-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>AND*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">and-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>BUT*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">but-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ALL*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">all-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>OTHER*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">other-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ME*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">me-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>OF*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">of-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>YES*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">yes-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NO*__WD</code></td><td>words of type 
 &#8249;<span class="token">no-word</span>&#8250;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="normal">In each case <code>*</code> runs from 1 to 3, 
except for <code>ALL*__WD</code> where it runs 1 to 5 and <code>OF*__WD</code>
where it runs 1 to 4. &#8249;<span class="token">of-words</span>&#8250; have 
not been mentioned before: these are used in the sense of &#8220;three 
of the boxes&#8221;, when parsing a reference to a given number of 
things. They are redundant in English because the player could have typed 
simply &#8220;three boxes&#8221;, but Inform provides them anyway.</p>

<p class="indent">In French, we might begin with:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant AGAIN1__WD   = 'encore';
Constant AGAIN2__WD   = 'c//';
Constant AGAIN3__WD   = 'encore';
</pre>

<p class="normal">Here we can't actually think of a third synonymous word 
for &#8220;again&#8221;, but we must define AGAIN3__WD all the same, 
and must not allow it to be zero. And so on, through to:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant YES1__WD     = 'o//';
Constant YES2__WD     = 'oui';
Constant YES3__WD     = 'oui';
</pre>

<a id="p273" name="p273"></a>
<p class="normal">&#8249;<span class="token">yes-words</span>&#8250; 
and &#8249;<span class="token">no-words</span>&#8250; are used to parse 
the answers to yes-or-no questions (oui-ou-non questions 
in French, of course). It causes no difficulty that the word &#8220;o&#8221;
is also an abbreviation for &#8220;ouest&#8221; because they are used 
in different contexts. On the other hand, &#8249;<span class="token">oops-words</span>&#8250;,
&#8249;<span class="token">again-words</span>&#8250; and 
&#8249;<span class="token">undo-words</span>&#8250; should be different 
from any verb or compass direction name.</p>

<p class="indent">After the above, a few further words have to be 
defined as possible replies to the question asked when a game ends. 
Here the French example might be:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant AMUSING__WD    = 'amusant';
Constant FULLSCORE1__WD = 'grandscore';
Constant FULLSCORE2__WD = 'grand';
Constant QUIT1__WD      = 'a//';
Constant QUIT2__WD      = 'arret';
Constant RESTART__WD    = 'reprand';
Constant RESTORE__WD    = 'restitue';
</pre>

<h3>(II.2) Informese vocabulary: pronouns</h3>

<p class="normal">Part II continues with a table of pronouns, best 
explained by example. The following table defines the standard 
English accusative pronouns:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Array LanguagePronouns table
  !  word       possible GNAs:                     connected to:
  !             a     i
  !             s  p  s  p
  !             mfnmfnmfnmfn
     'it'     $$001000111000                       NULL
     'him'    $$100000100000                       NULL
     'her'    $$010000010000                       NULL
     'them'   $$000111000111                       NULL;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The &#8220;connected to&#8221; column should always 
be created with <code>NULL</code> entries. The pattern of 1 and 0 
in the middle column indicates which types of 
&#8249;<span class="token">noun phrase</span>&#8250; might be referred
to with the given &#8249;<span class="token">pronoun</span>&#8250;. 
This is really a concise way of expressing a set of possible GNA 
values, saying for instance that &#8220;them&#8221; can match against 
noun phrases with any GNA in the set {3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11}.</p>

<p class="indent">The accusative and dative pronouns in English 
are identical: for instance &#8220;her&#8221; in &#8220;give her the 
flowers&#8221; is dative and in &#8220;kiss her&#8221; is accusative. 
French is richer in pronoun forms:</p>

<p class="syntax">donne-le-lui &nbsp; <i>give it to him/her</i><br>
mange avec lui &nbsp; <i>eat with him</i></p>

<p class="normal">Here &#8220;-lui&#8221; and &#8220;lui&#8221; are 
grammatically quite different, with one implying masculinity where 
the other doesn't. The table needed is:</p>

<h3>(II.3) Informese vocabulary: descriptors</h3>

<p class="normal">Part II continues with a table of descriptors, in 
a similar format.</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Array LanguageDescriptors table

     'these'  $$000111000111    POSSESS_PK      0
     'that'   $$111111111111    POSSESS_PK      1
     'those'  $$000111000111    POSSESS_PK      1
     'his'    $$111111111111    POSSESS_PK      'him'
     'her'    $$111111111111    POSSESS_PK      'her'
     'their'  $$111111111111    POSSESS_PK      'them'
     'its'    $$111111111111    POSSESS_PK      'it'
     'the'    $$111111111111    DEFART_PK       NULL
     'a//'    $$111000111000    INDEFART_PK     NULL
     'an'     $$111000111000    INDEFART_PK     NULL
     'some'   $$000111000111    INDEFART_PK     NULL;
</pre>

<p class="normal">This gives three of the four types of 
&#8249;<span class="token">descriptor</span>&#8250;. The constant 
<code>POSSESS_PK</code> signifies a &#8249;<span class="token">possessive adjective</span>&#8250;, 
connected either to 0, meaning the player-object, or to 1, meaning 
anything other than the player-object (used for &#8220;that&#8221; 
and similar words) or to the object referred to by the given 
&#8249;<span class="token">pronoun</span>&#8250;, which must be one 
of those in the pronoun table. <code>DEFART_PK</code> signifies a 
definite &#8249;<span class="token">article</span>&#8250; and 
<code>INDEFART_PK</code> an indefinite &#8249;<span class="token">article</span>&#8250;: 
these should both give the connected-to value of <code>NULL</code> 
in all cases.</p>

<p class="indent">The fourth kind allows extra descriptors to be added 
which force the objects that follow to have, or not have, a given attribute. 
For example, the following three lines would implement &#8220;lit&#8221;, 
&#8220;lighted&#8221; and &#8220;unlit&#8221; as adjectives automatically 
understood by the English parser:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
     'lit'     $$111111111111    light           NULL
     'lighted' $$111111111111    light           NULL
     'unlit'   $$111111111111    (-light)        NULL
</pre>

<p class="normal">An attribute name means &#8220;must have this attribute&#8221;, 
while the negation of it means &#8220;must not have this attribute&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">To continue the example, <tt>&quot;French.h&quot;</tt> needs the 
following descriptors table:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Array LanguageDescriptors table

     'les'    $$000110000110    DEFART_PK       NULL
     'un'     $$100000100000    INDEFART_PK     NULL<a id="p276" name="p276"></a>
     'une'    $$010000010000    INDEFART_PK     NULL
     'des'    $$000110000110    INDEFART_PK     NULL
     'mon'    $$100000100000    POSSESS_PK      0
     'ma'     $$010000010000    POSSESS_PK      0
     'mes'    $$000110000110    POSSESS_PK      0
     'son'    $$100000100000    POSSESS_PK      '-lui'
     'sa'     $$010000010000    POSSESS_PK      '-lui'
     'ses'    $$000110000110    POSSESS_PK      '-lui'
     'leur'   $$110000110000    POSSESS_PK      '-les'
     'leurs'  $$000110000110    POSSESS_PK      '-les';
</pre>

<p class="normal">(recall that in dictionary words, the apostrophe is 
written <code>^</code>). Thus, &#8220;son oiseau&#8221; means &#8220;his 
bird&#8221; or &#8220;her bird&#8221;, according to the current meaning 
of &#8220;-lui&#8221;, i.e., according to the gender of the most 
recent singular noun referred to.</p>

<p class="indent">The parser automatically tries both meanings if the 
same word occurs in both pronoun and descriptor tables. This happens 
in English, where &#8220;her&#8221; can mean either a feminine 
singular possessive adjective (&#8220;take her purse&#8221;) or a 
feminine singular object pronoun (&#8220;wake her up&#8221;).</p>

<h3>(II.4) Informese vocabulary: numbers</h3>

<p class="normal">An array should be given of words having type 
&#8249;<span class="token">number</span>&#8250;. These should include 
enough to express the numbers 1 to 20, as in the example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Array LanguageNumbers table
    'un' 1 'une' 1 'deux' 2 'trois' 3 'quatre' 4 'cinq' 5
    'six' 6 'sept' 7 'huit' 8 'neuf' 9 'dix' 10
    'onze' 11 'douze' 12 'treize' 13 'quatorze' 14 'quinze' 15
    'seize' 16 'dix-sept' 17 'dix-huit' 18 'dix-neuf' 19 'vingt' 20;
</pre>

<p class="normal">In some languages, such as Russian, there are numbers 
larger than 1 which inflect with gender: please recognise all possibilities 
here. If the same word appears in both numbers and descriptors tables, 
its meaning as a descriptor takes priority, which is useful in French 
as it means that the genders of &#8220;un&#8221; and &#8220;une&#8221; 
are recognised after all.</p>

<h3>(III.1) Translating natural language to Informese</h3>

<p class="normal">Part III holds the routine to convert what the player 
has typed into Informese. In <tt>&quot;English.h&quot;</tt> this does 
nothing at all:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">[ LanguageToInformese; ];</pre>

<p class="normal">This might just do for Dogg, the imaginary language in 
which Tom Stoppard's play <i>Dogg's Hamlet</i> is written, where the 
words are more or less English words rearranged. (It begins with someone 
tapping a microphone and saying &#8220;Breakfast, breakfast&#8230; 
sun, dock, trog&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;Bicycles!&#8221; is an 
expletive.) Other languages are structurally unlike 
<a id="p277" name="p277"></a>
English and the task of <code>LanguageToInformese</code> is to rearrange or rewrite 
commands to make them look more like English ones. Here are some typical 
procedures for <code>LanguageToInformese</code> to follow:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;margin-top:0">
<li>Strip out optional accents. For instance, <tt>&quot;German.h&quot;</tt> 
 looks through the command replacing &uuml; with <code>ue</code> and so 
 forth, and replacing &#223; with <code>ss</code>. This saves having 
 to recognise both spelling forms.</li>
<li>Break up words at hyphens and apostrophes, so that:
 <p class="syntax">donne-lui l'oiseau &nbsp; <i>give the bird to him</i>
 &rarr; donne -lui l' oiseau</p></li>
<li>Remove inflections which don't carry useful information. For 
 instance, most German imperatives can take two forms, one with an 
 &#8216;e&#8217; on the end: &#8220;lege&#8221; means &#8220;leg&#8221; 
 (German: &#8220;put&#8221;) and &#8220;schaue&#8221; means &#8220;schau&#8221; 
 (German: &#8220;look&#8221;). It would be helpful to remove this 
 &#8220;e&#8221;, if only to avoid stuffing game dictionaries full 
 of essentially duplicate entries. (Toni Arnold's <tt>&quot;German.h&quot;</tt> 
 goes further and strips all inflections from nouns, while Ralf Herrmann's 
 preserves inflections for parsing later on.)</li>
<li>Break affixes away from the words they're glued to. For instance:
 <p class="syntax">della &nbsp; <i>of the</i> (Italian) &rarr; di la<br>
 cogela &nbsp; <i>take it</i> (Spanish) &rarr; coge la</p>
 so that the affix part &#8220;la&#8221; becomes a separate word and 
 can be treated as a pronoun.</li>
<li>Replace parts of speech not existing in Informese, such as pronominal 
 adverbs, with a suitable alternative. For instance:
 <p class="syntax">dessus &nbsp; <i>on top of it</i> (French) &rarr; sur lui<br>
 dedans &nbsp; <i>inside it</i> &rarr; dans lui</p></li>
<li>Alter word order. For instance, break off an enclitic and move it 
 between two nouns; or if the definite article is written as a suffix, 
 cut it free and move it before the noun:
 <p class="syntax">arma virumque &nbsp; <i>arms and the man</i> (Latin)
 &rarr; arma et virum<br>
 kakane &nbsp; <i>the cakes</i> (Norwegian) &rarr; ne kake</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="normal">When the call to <code>LanguageToInformese</code> 
is made, the text that the player typed is held in a <code>-&gt;</code> 
array called <code>buffer</code>, and some useful information about it 
is held in another array called <code>parse</code>. The contents of 
these arrays are described in detail in <a href="s2.html#s2_5">&#167;2.5</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The translation process has to be done by shifting 
characters about and altering them in <code>buffer</code>. Of course 
the moment anything in <code>buffer</code> is changed, the information
<a id="p278" name="p278"></a>
in <code>parse</code> becomes out of date. You can update <code>parse</code> 
with the assembly-language statement</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">@tokenise buffer parse;</pre>

<p class="normal">(And the parser does just this when the <code>LanguageToInformese</code> 
routine has finished.) The most commonly made alterations come down to 
inserting characters, often spaces, in between words, and deleting other 
characters by overwriting them with spaces. Inserting characters means 
moving the rest of <code>buffer</code> along by one character, altering the length 
<code>buffer-&gt;1</code>, and making sure that no overflow occurs. 
The library therefore provides a utility routine</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">LTI_Insert(position, character)</pre>

<p class="normal">to insert the given character at the given position 
in <code>buffer</code>.</p>

<h2>&#167;25 &nbsp; Extending and redefining the world model</h2>

<blockquote>A circulating library in a town is as an ever-green 
tree of diabolical knowledge! It blossoms through the year!<br>
&#8212; R. B. Sheridan (1751&#8211;1816), <i>The Rivals</i></blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-198_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
In <i>The History of Zork</i>, Tim Anderson summed up the genesis of
the &#8216;Zork I&#8217; world model &#8211; and perhaps also its 
exodus, that is, its adaptation to other games &#8211; when he 
commented that &#8220;the general problem always remained: anything 
that changes the world you're modelling changes practically everything 
in the world you're modelling.&#8221; Substantial changes to the world 
model often have profound implications and can lead to endless headaches 
in play-testing if not thought through. Even a single object can upset 
the plausibility of the whole: a spray-can, for instance, unless 
its use is carefully circumscribed. On the other hand, introducing 
whole categories of objects often causes no difficulty at all, if they 
do not upset existing ideas such as that of door, location, container 
and so on. For instance, the set of collectable Tarot cards in the game 
&#8216;Curses&#8217; have numerous rules governing their behaviour, 
but never cause the basic rules of play to alter for other items or 
places.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In making such an extension the natural strategy is 
simply to define a new class of objects, and to take advantage of Inform's 
message system to make designing such objects as easy and flexible as 
possible. For example, suppose we need a class of Egyptian magical amulets, 
small arrowhead-like totems worn on the wrist and made of semi-precious 
minerals, with cartoon-like carvings. (The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 
has an extensive collection.) Each amulet is to have the power (but 
only if worn) to cast a different spell. Almost all of the code for this 
will go into a class definition called <code>Amulet</code>. This means 
that</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">if (noun ofclass Amulet) ...</pre>

<p class="normal">provides a convenient test to see if an object <code>noun</code> 
is an amulet, and so forth. (This imposes a restriction that an object 
can't start or stop being an amulet in the course of play, because class 
membership is forever. If this restriction were unacceptable, a new 
attribute would need to be created instead, in the same way that the 
standard world model recognises any object with the attribute
<code>container</code> as a container, rather than having a <code>Container</code> 
class.)</p>

<a id="p199" name="p199"></a>
<p class="normal">Suppose the requirement is that the player should 
be able to type &#8220;cast jasper amulet&#8221;, which would work 
so long as the jasper amulet were being worn. It seems sensible to 
create an action called <code>Cast</code>, and this necessitates
creating an action subroutine to deal with it:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
[ CastSub;
  &quot;Nothing happens.&quot;;
];
Verb 'cast' 'invoke' * noun -&gt; Cast;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Nothing happens here because the code is kept with 
the <code>Amulet</code> class instead:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Class Amulet
  with amulet_spell &quot;Nothing happens.&quot;,
       before [ destination;
           Cast:
               if (self hasnt worn)
                   &quot;The amulet rattles loosely in your hand.&quot;;
               destination = self.amulet_spell();
               switch (destination) {
                   false: &quot;Nothing happens.&quot;;
                   true: ;
                   default: print &quot;Osiris summons you to...^&quot;;
                       PlayerTo(destination);
               }
               rtrue;
       ],
  has  clothing;
</pre>

<p class="normal">Thus every <code>Amulet</code> provides an 
<code>amulet_spell</code> message, which answers the question &#8220;you 
have been cast: what happens now?&#8221; The reply is either <code>false</code>,
meaning nothing has happened; true, meaning that something did happen; 
or else an object or room to teleport the player to.</p>

<p class="indent">From the designer's point of view, once the above 
extension has been made, amulets are easy to create and have legible 
code. Here are four example spells:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
amulet_spell &quot;The spell fizzles out with a dull phut! sound.&quot;,
amulet_spell [;
    if (location == thedark) {
        give real_location light;
        &quot;There is a burst of magical light!&quot;;
    }
],
amulet_spell HiddenVault,<a id="p200" name="p200"></a>
amulet_spell [;
    return random(LeadRoom, SilverRoom, GoldRoom);
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">An elaborate library extension will end up defining 
many classes, grammar, actions and verb definitions, and these may 
neatly be packaged up into an <code>Include</code> file and to be 
placed among the library files.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Such a file should contain the directive <code>System_file;</code>, 
as then other designers will be able to <code>Replace</code> routines 
from it, just as with the rest of the library.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">So much for extending the Inform model with new classes: 
the rest of the section is about modifying what's ordinarily there. 
The simplest change, but often all that's needed, is to change a few 
of the standard responses called &#8220;library messages&#8221;, 
such as the &#8220;Nothing is on sale.&#8221; which ends to be 
printed when the player asks to buy something, or the &#8220;Taken.&#8221; 
when something is picked up. (To change every message, and with it 
the language of the game, see <a href="s34.html">&#167;34</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent">To set new library messages, provide a special 
object called <code>LibraryMessages</code>, which must be defined <em>between</em> 
the inclusion of the <code>&quot;Parser.h&quot;</code> and
<code>&quot;Verblib.h&quot;</code> library files. This object should 
have just one property, a <code>before</code> rule. 
For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object LibraryMessages
  with before [;
           Jump: if (real_location ofclass ISS_Module)
               &quot;You jump and float helplessly for a while in zero
               gravity here on the International Space Station.&quot;;
           SwitchOn:
               if (lm_n == 3) {
                   &quot;You power up &quot;, (the) lm_o, &quot;.&quot;;
               }
       ];
</pre>

<p class="normal">This object is never visible in the game, but its 
<code>before</code> rule is consulted before any message is printed: 
if it returns <code>false</code>, the standard message is printed; 
if <code>true</code>, then nothing is printed, as it's assumed 
that this has already happened.</p>

<p class="indent">The <code>Jump</code> action only ever prints one 
message (usually &#8220;You jump on the spot.&#8221;), but more 
elaborate actions such as <code>SwitchOn</code> have several, and 
<code>Take</code> has thirteen. The library's variable <code>lm_n</code> 
holds the message number, which counts upwards from 1. In some cases, 
the object being talked about is held 
<a id="p201" name="p201"></a>
in <code>lm_o</code>. The 
messages and numbers are given in <a href="sa4.html">&#167;A4</a>. 
New message numbers may possibly be added in future, but old ones will 
not be renumbered.</p>

<p class="indent">An especially useful library message to change is 
the prompt, normally set to <code>&quot;^&gt;&quot;</code> (new-line followed by 
&gt;). This is printed under the action <code>Prompt</code> (actually 
a fake action existing for this very purpose). You can use this to 
make the game's prompt context-sensitive, or to remove the new-line 
from before the prompt.</p>

<a id="ex59" name="ex59"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans59">EXERCISE 59</a></b></span><br>
Infocom's game &#8216;The Witness&#8217; has the prompt &#8220;What 
should you, the detective, do next?&#8221; on turn one and &#8220;What 
next?&#8221; subsequently. Implement this.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
<code>LibraryMessages</code> can also be used as a flexible way to 
alter the rules governing individual actions. Here are two examples 
in the guise of exercises.</p>


<a id="ex60" name="ex60"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans60">EXERCISE 60</a></b></span><br>
Under the standard world model (&#182;6.7.4 in <a href="s24.html">&#167;24</a> 
above), a player standing on top of something is not allowed to 
type, say, &#8220;east&#8221; to leave the room: the message &#8220;You'll
have to get off&#8230; first&#8221; is printed instead. Change this.</p>

<a id="ex61" name="ex61"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans61">EXERCISE 61</a></b></span><br>
Under standard rules (&#182;6.6.1 in <a href="s24.html">&#167;24</a> 
above), a player trying to &#8220;push&#8221; something which is 
not <code>static</code> or <code>scenery</code> or <code>animate</code> 
will find that &#8220;Nothing obvious happens&#8221;. Add the rule 
that an attempt to push a <code>switchable</code> item is to be 
considered as an attempt to switch it on, if it's off, and vice versa. 
(This might be useful if a game has many buttons and levers.)</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The Library is itself written in Inform, and with 
experience it's not too hard to alter it if need be. But to edit and 
change the library files themselves is an inconvenience and an inelegant 
way to carry on, because it would lead to needing a separate copy 
of all the files for each project you work on. Because of this, Inform 
allows you to <code>Replace</code> any routine or routines of your choice
from the library, giving a definition of your own which is to be used 
instead of the one in the standard files. For example, if the directive</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Replace BurnSub;</pre>

<p class="normal">is placed in your file <em>before the library files 
are included</em>, Inform ignores the definition of <code>BurnSub</code> in 
the library files. You then have to define a routine called <code>BurnSub</code> 
yourself: looking in the library file <tt>&quot;Verblib.h&quot;</tt>, 
the original turns out to be tiny:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">[ BurnSub; L__M(##Burn,1,noun); ];</pre>

<a id="p202" name="p202"></a>
<p class="normal">All this does is to print out library message number 
1 for <code>Burn</code>, the somewhat preachy &#8220;This dangerous 
act would achieve little.&#8221; You could instead write a fuller 
<code>BurnSub</code> providing for a new concept of an object being 
&#8220;on fire&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Inform even allows you to <code>Replace</code> &#8220;hardware&#8221; 
functions like <code>random</code> or <code>parent</code>, which 
would normally be translated directly to machine opcodes. 
This is even more &#8220;at your own risk&#8221; than ordinary usages 
of <code>Replace</code>.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">What are the implications of fire likely to be? One 
way to find out is to read through the world model (<a href="s24.html">&#167;24</a>) 
and see how fire ought to affect each group of rules. Evidently we have 
just created a new possible internal state for an object, which means 
a new rule under &#182;1, but it doesn't stop there:</p>

<div class="clump">
<p class="indent">1.4.4. Some objects are &#8220;flammable&#8221; 
and therefore in one of two mutually exclusive states, &#8220;on 
fire&#8221; and &#8220;not on fire&#8221;.</p>
<p class="indent">2.4. If an object on fire is placed in a flammable 
container or on a flammable supporter, that too catches fire.</p>
<p class="indent">2.5. If a container or supporter is on fire, any 
flammable object within or on top of it catches fire.</p>
<p class="indent">4.3.3.1. Any object on fire provides light.</p>
<p class="indent">4.4.3. The player cannot touch any object on fire 
unless (say) wearing the asbestos gloves.</p>
<p class="indent">5.4.1. All flammable objects have a &#8220;lifespan&#8221;, 
a length of time for which they can burn before being consumed. 
The each-turn daemon subtracts one from the lifespan of any object 
on fire, and removes it from play if the lifespan reaches zero.</p>
</div>

<p class="normal">One could go further than this: arguably, certain 
rooms should also be flammable, so that an object on fire which is 
dropped there would set the room ablaze; and the player should not 
survive long in a burning room; and we have not even provided a way 
to douse the flames, except by waiting for fires to burn themselves 
out. But the above rules will maintain a reasonable level of
plausibility. &#182;1.4.4 is provided by defining a new class of 
<code>Flammable</code> objects, which contains an <code>each_turn</code> 
routine implementing &#182;5.4.1, and an <code>on_fire</code> attribute. 
The same <code>each_turn</code> can take care of &#182;2.4 and 
&#182;2.5, and can give the object <code>light</code> if it's currently 
<code>on_fire</code>, thus solving &#182;4.3.3.1. But, while it would 
be easy to add simple rules like &#8220;you can't <em>take</em> an 
object which is on fire&#8221;, &#182;4.4.3 in its fullest form is 
more problematic, and means replacing the <code>ObjectIsUntouchable</code> 
routine. Giving any object on fire a <code>before</code> rule
preventing the player from using any of the &#8220;touchy&#8221; 
actions on it would go some of the way, but wouldn't handle subtler 
cases, like a player not being 
<a id="p203" name="p203"></a>
allowed to reach for something through 
a burning hoop. Nor is this everything: burning objects will need to 
be talked about differently when alight, and this will call for 
using the powerful descriptive features in <a href="ch4.html">Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
&#8216;Balances&#8217; implements the &#8216;Enchanter&#8217; trilogy's 
magic system by methods like the above. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Approximately seventy library 
extensions have been contributed by members of the Inform community 
and more are placed at <tt>ftp.gmd.de</tt> with each month that goes
by. Often short and legible, they make good examples of Inform coding 
even if you don't want to use them. Many are cited in &#8220;references&#8221; 
paragraphs throughout the book: here are others which seem more appropriate 
here. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span><tt>&quot;money.h&quot;</tt>, 
by Erik Hetzner, is a textbook case of a class-based extension to 
Inform providing a new aspect to the world model which doesn't much 
overlap with what's already there: notes and coinage. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Conversely, Marnie Parker's 
<tt>&quot;OutOfRch.h&quot;</tt> exemplifies a change that needs to 
permeate the existing world model to be effective: it defines which 
areas of a location are within reach from which other areas, so that 
for instance a player sitting on a chair might only be able to reach 
items on the adjacent table and not a window on the far wall. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>In some graphical adventure 
games, interactivity sometimes cuts out at a significant event and 
an unchangeable movie animation is shown instead: this is sometimes 
called a &#8220;cut-scene&#8221;. Such games sometimes allow the player 
to replay any movies seen so far, reviewing them for clues missed 
previously. <tt>&quot;movie.h&quot;</tt>, by L. Ross Raszewski, projects 
the textual version of movies like this, thus providing a framework 
for cut-scenes. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span><tt>&quot;infotake.h&quot;</tt>, 
by Joe Merical, shifts the Inform model world back to the style of 
&#8216;Zork&#8217;: printing Zorkesque messages, providing a 
&#8220;diagnose&#8221; verb and so on. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Anson Turner's <tt>&quot;animalib&quot;</tt> 
retains the core algorithms of the Inform library (principally the 
parser and list-writer) but redesigns the superstructure of properties 
and attributes with the aim of a cleaner, more consistent world model.
Although this alternative library is in its early stages of development, 
its code makes interesting reading. For instance, some child-objects 
represent items held inside their parents and others represent items 
on top of their parents. The standard Inform library distinguishes 
these cases by looking at the attributes of the parent-object 
&#8211; whether it is a <code>supporter</code> or a <code>container</code>. 
Contrariwise, <tt>&quot;animalib&quot;</tt> distinguishes them by 
looking at attributes of the child, so that the different children 
of a single parent can all be contained in different ways.</p>

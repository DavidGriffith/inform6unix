The Inform library in ../lib is version 6/11
Copyright Graham Nelson 1993-2004

The standard header files are stored in lower-case here.  Symbolic links to
other semi-standard names get created upon installation (e.g. verblib.h
gets symlinked to Verblib.h and VerbLib.h).  Except on Cygwin, where case
doesn't seem to matter.

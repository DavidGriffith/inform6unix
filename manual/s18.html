<h2>&#167;18 &nbsp; Making conversation</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-148_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
To listen is far harder than to speak. This section overlaps with
<a href="ch4.html">Chapter IV</a>, the chapter on parsing text, 
and the later exercises are among the hardest in the book. As the 
following summary table shows, the simpler ways for the player to 
speak to people were covered in the previous section: this section 
is about &#8220;orders&#8221;.</p>

<p class="normal">Here we're supposing that the game's dictionary 
includes &#8220;troll&#8221;, &#8220;orc&#8221; and so forth, but 
not &#8220;wyvern&#8221;, which is why &#8220;ask orc about wyvern&#8221; 
results in the action <code>Ask orc 0</code>. The notation <code>NotU...</code>
is an abbreviation for <code>NotUnderstood</code>, of which more later. 
The two numbers in the &#8220;consult&#8221; column are the values 
of <code>consult_from</code> and <code>consult_words</code>, in 
cases where they are set.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">When the player types in something like &#8220;pilot, 
fly south&#8221;, addressing an object which has <code>animate</code> or 
at least <code>talkable</code>, the result is called an &#8216;order&#8217;.</p>

<p class="indent">The order is sent to the pilot's <code>orders</code> property, 
which may if it wishes comply or react in some other way. Otherwise, 
the standard game rules will simply print something like &#8220;The 
pilot has better things to do.&#8221; The &#8216;Ruins&#8217; priest 
is especially unhelpful:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
orders [;
    Go: &quot;~I must not leave the Shrine.~&quot;;
    NotUnderstood: &quot;~You speak in riddles.~&quot;;
    default: &quot;~It is not your orders I serve.~&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">The <code>NotUnderstood</code> clause of an <code>orders</code> 
rule is run when the parser couldn't understand what the player typed: 
e.g., &#8220;pilot, fly somersaults&#8221;.</p>

<a id="p149" name="p149"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The Inform library regards 
the words &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; as being verbs, 
so it parses &#8220;delores, yes&#8221; into a <code>Yes</code> 
order. This can be a slight nuisance, as &#8220;say yes to delores&#8221;
is treated differently: it gets routed through the <code>life</code> 
routine as an <code>Answer</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
When a <code>NotUnderstood</code> order is being passed to <code>orders</code>, 
the library sets up some variables to help you parse by hand if you 
need to. The actual order, say &#8220;fly somersaults&#8221;, becomes 
a sort of consultation topic, with <code>consult_from</code> and
<code>consult_words</code> set to the first word number and the number 
of words. The variable <code>etype</code> holds the parser error that 
would have been printed out, had it been a command by the player himself. 
See <a href="s33.html">&#167;33</a>: for instance, the value 
<code>CANTSEE_PE</code> would mean &#8220;the pilot can't see any 
such object&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
If the <code>orders</code> property returns <code>false</code> or 
if there wasn't an <code>orders</code> property in the first place, 
the order is sent on either to the <code>Order:</code> part of the 
<code>life</code> property, if it was understood, or to the 
<code>Answer:</code> part, if it wasn't. (This is how all orders 
used to be processed, and it's retained to avoid making old Inform 
code go wrong.) If these also return <code>false</code>, a message 
like &#8220;<i>X</i> has better things to do&#8221; (if understood) 
or &#8220;There is no reply&#8221; (if not) is finally printed.</p>

For many designers, <code>Answer</code> and <code>Tell</code> are 
just too much trouble. How can you make attempts to use these 
produce a message saying &#8220;To talk to someone, try &#8216;someone,
something&#8217;.&#8221;?</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">When the player issues a request to an <code>animate</code> or 
<code>talkable</code> object, they're normally parsed in the standard 
way. &#8220;avon, take the bracelet&#8221; results in the order 
<code>Take bracelet</code> being sent to Kerr Avon, just as typing 
&#8220;take the bracelet&#8221; results in the action <code>Take 
bracelet</code> passing to the player. The range of text understood 
is the same, whether or not the person addressed is Avon. Sometimes, 
though, one would rather that different people understood entirely
different grammars.</p>

<p class="indent">For instance, consider Zen, the flight computer 
of an alien spacecraft. It's inappropriate to tell Zen to pick up 
a teleport bracelet and the crew tend to give commands more like:</p>

<p class="output">&#8220;Zen, set course for Centauro&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Zen, speed standard by six&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Zen, scan 360 orbital&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Zen, raise the force wall&#8221;<br><a id="p150" name="p150"></a>
&#8220;Zen, clear the neutron blasters for firing&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">For such commands, an <code>animate</code> or 
<code>talkable</code> object can if it likes provide a <code>grammar</code> 
property. This is called at a time when the parser has worked out 
the object being addressed and has set the variables <code>verb_wordnum</code> 
and <code>verb_word</code> to the word number of the &#8216;verb&#8217; 
and its dictionary entry, respectively. For example, in &#8220;orac, 
operate the teleport&#8221; <code>verb_wordnum</code> would be 3, 
because the comma counts as a word on its own, and <code>verb_word</code> 
would be <code>'operate'</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">Once called, the <code>grammar</code> routine can 
reply to the parser by returning:</p>

<div class="inset"><dl>
<dt><code>false</code></dt> 
 <dd>Meaning &#8220;carry on as usual&#8221;.</dd>
<dt><code>true</code></dt>
 <dd>Meaning &#8220;you can stop parsing now because I have done 
 it all, and put the resulting order into the variables <code>action</code>, 
 <code>noun</code> and <code>second</code>&#8221;.</dd>
<dt><code>'verb'</code></dt>
 <dd>Meaning &#8220;don't use the standard game grammar: use the 
 grammar lines for this verb instead&#8221;.</dd>
<dt><code>-'verb'</code></dt>
 <dd>Meaning &#8220;use the grammar lines for this verb, and if none 
 of them match, use the standard game grammar as usual&#8221;.</dd>
</dl></div>

<p class="normal">In addition, the <code>grammar</code> routine is 
free to do some partial parsing of the early words provided it moves 
on <code>verb_wordnum</code> accordingly to show how much it's got 
through.</p>

When devising unusual grammars, you sometimes want to define grammar 
lines that the player can only use when talking to other people. The 
vile trick to achieve this is to attach these grammar lines to an 
&#8220;untypeable verb&#8221;, such as <code>'comp,'</code>. This 
can never match what the player typed because the parser automatically 
separates the text &#8220;comp,&#8221; into two words, &#8220;comp&#8221; 
and &#8220;,&#8221;, with a space between them. The same will happen 
with any word of up to 7 letters followed by a comma or full stop. 
For instance, here's one way to solve the &#8216;Starcross&#8217; 
computer exercise, using an untypeable verb:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<a id="p151" name="p151"></a>
<pre class="code">
[ Control;
  switch (NextWord()) {
      'theta': parsed_number = 1; return GPR_NUMBER;
      'phi':   parsed_number = 2; return GPR_NUMBER;
      'range': parsed_number = 3; return GPR_NUMBER;
      default: return GPR_FAIL;
  }
];
Verb 'comp,' * Control 'is' number -&gt; SetTo;
</pre>

<p class="aside">(Here, <code>Control</code> is a &#8220;general 
parsing routine&#8221;: see <a href="s31.html">&#167;31</a>.) 
The computer itself then needs these properties:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
grammar [; return 'comp,'; ],
orders [;
    SetTo:
        switch (noun) {
            1: print &quot;~Theta&quot;; 2: print &quot;~Phi&quot;; 3: print &quot;~Range&quot;;
        }
        &quot; set to &quot;, second, &quot;.~&quot;;
    default: &quot;~Does not compute!~&quot;;
];
</pre>

<p class="aside">This may not look easier, but it's much more flexible, 
as the exercises below may demonstrate.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
To trump one vile trick with another, untypeable verbs are also 
sometimes used to create what might be called &#8216;fake fake 
actions&#8217;. Recall that a fake action is one which is never 
generated by the parser, and has no action routine. For instance, 
there's no <code>ThrownAtSub</code>, because <code>ThrownAt</code> 
is a fake. A fake fake action is a half-measure: it's a full action 
in every respect, including having an action routine, except that 
it can never be generated by the parser. The following grammar line 
creates three of them, called <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Simmer</code> 
and <code>Cook</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Verb 'fakes.' * -&gt; Prepare * -&gt; Simmer * -&gt; Cook;</pre>

algebraic geometry seminar by Peter Kronheimer on fake and fake 
fake K3 surfaces.</p>

Difficult &#8220;someone on the other end of a phone&#8221; situations 
turn up quite often in one form or another (see, for instance, the

solution is fine. If you just want to make something like 
&#8220;michael, tell me about the crystals&#8221; work, when Michael 
is at the other end of the line, give the phone the talkable attribute 
and make the word 'michael' one of its names. If several people 
are on the phone at different times, you can always give the phone 
a <code>parse_name</code> property (see <a href="s28.html">&#167;28</a>) 
to respond to different names at different times.</p>

A much fuller example of a &#8216;non-player character&#8217; is 
given in the example game &#8216;The Thief&#8217;, by Gareth Rees 
(though it's really an implementation of the gentleman in 
&#8216;Zork I&#8217;, himself an imitation of the pirate in 
&#8216;Advent&#8217;). The thief is capable of walking around, being 
followed, stealing things, picking locks, opening doors and so on. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Other good definitions of 
<code>animate</code> objects to look at are Christopher in 
&#8216;Toyshop&#8217;, who will stack up building blocks on request; 
the kittens in &#8216;Alice Through the Looking-Glass&#8217;; the

<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>A wandering character with

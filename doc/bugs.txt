Known bugs in this release
==========================

* Version 6.21 of Inform crashes if strict checking (-S) is used with
  modules (-U).  This is puzzling to me, since -S is the default.  So I
  would expect anyone who uses modules without explicitly turning strict
  checking off to report a bug, but no-one seems to have.  If anyone can
  explain this, I'd be interested to hear it.

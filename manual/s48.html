<h2>&#167;48 &nbsp; A triangle of identities</h2>

<blockquote>&#8220;Queer grammar!&#8221; said Holmes with a smile 
as he handed the paper back to the inspector. &#8220;Did you notice 
how the &#8216;he&#8217; suddenly changed to &#8216;my&#8217;? The 
writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself 
at the supreme moment to be the hero.&#8221;<br>
&#8212; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859&#8211;1930), <i>Three Gables</i></blockquote>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-378_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
In books like this one the word &#8220;player&#8221; is overused. There 
are at least three identities involved in play: the person typing and 
reading (&#8220;player&#8221;), the main character within the story 
(&#8220;protagonist&#8221;), and the voice speaking about what this 
character sees and feels (&#8220;narrator&#8221;). There is a triangle 
of relationships between them, and it's a triangle with very different 
proportions in different games.

<p class="normal" style="margin-top:1em">1. <i>Protagonist and player.</i>&nbsp;
&#8220;What should you, the detective, do now?&#8221; asks &#8216;The 
Witness&#8217; pointedly on its first turn. Numerous games (&#8216;Zork&#8217;, 
for instance) take the attitude that anyone who turns up can play, as 
themselves, regardless of gender or attitudes. This is to equate player 
with protagonist, making them almost the same. Sometimes the equation 
is actually engineered: &#8216;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&#8217; 
notices into which bathroom the player chooses to move the protagonist 
and decides the protagonist's gender accordingly. &#8216;Seastalker&#8217;
(Stu Galley and Jim Lawrence, 1984), aimed at a younger audience, asks 
for the player's name and gives it to the protagonist, too. At the 
other extreme is Amy Briggs's much underplayed &#8216;Plundered 
Hearts&#8217; (1987), which has as its heroine a specific girl whisked 
away by pirates in the West Indies. Reviewing in <i>SPAG</i> 4, 
Graeme Cree wrote that:</p>

<blockquote>In &#8216;Zork&#8217;, you're just some anonymous guy who 
was walking by the white house. You have no particular personality, 
or history before this point. &#8216;Planetfall&#8217; makes an effort 
to paint your character with the enclosed diary, but it is all chrome
&#8230; &#8216;Plundered Hearts&#8217;, more than any other game gave
me the feeling of really being inside someone <em>else's</em> head. 
Throughout the game, who you are plays an important part. Disguising 
your identity and altering your appearance is important in several 
places to elicit a desired reaction from other characters &#8230;</blockquote>

<p class="normal">Either approach presents difficulties. If the protagonist 
is uncharacterised, the story may lack literary interest. If heavily 
determined, the protagonist is likely to be highly unlike the player 
and this risks losing the player's sense of engagement.</p>

<a id="p379" name="p379"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Few players have minded becoming the Reverend Stephen Dawson, the 
middle-aged clergyman of &#8216;Muse, an Autumn Romance&#8217; (Christopher 
Huang, 1998), whose behaviour is constrained by his emotional blockage. 
But there are players who resent being obliged to identify with gay 
protagonists. On the whole this is their problem, not the game's, 
and it was for them that Neil James Brown wrote his pointed spoof 
&#8216;The Lost Spellmaker&#8217; (1997), the exploit of Mattie, a lesbian 
dwarf Secret Service agent addicted to sweets.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">In an interactive medium, the beliefs and abilities 
of the protagonist are more than simply a painted backcloth, because 
the player participates in them. These special abilities might be called 
the &#8220;magic&#8221; in the game's model world, in the broadest sense:</p>

<blockquote>For magic and applied science alike the problem is how 
to subdue reality to the wishes of man.</blockquote>

<p class="normal">(C. S. Lewis, <i>The Abolition of Man</i>.) In &#8216;The 
Witness&#8217;, for instance, the magic might be said to be the detective's 
ability to arrest or call for forensic analysis, and in &#8216;Ruins&#8217; 
we have the camera and the packing case. The magic is the imaginary 
fabric of the world, and it is as essential for the magic to have a
coherent rationale as it is for the map to suggest a coherent geography.</p>

<p class="indent">Because the magic is part of the background, it should 
not be allowed to become too crudely a way to solve puzzles. An &#8220;open 
door&#8221; spell should be a general technique, with several different 
applications across its game. Better yet, these techniques should be 
used indirectly and with ingenuity, for instance opening a locked door 
by casting a &#8220;cause to rust&#8221; spell on its hinges. And
plenty of puzzles should have solutions which don't involve the magic 
at all, or else the player will start to feel that it would save a good 
deal of time and effort just to find the &#8220;win game&#8221; spell 
and be done with it.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
In a few games a linguistic surrealism is the reality: for instance 
&#8216;Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It&#8217; (Jeff 
O'Neill, 1987) is entirely based on puns and the T-Removing Machine 
of &#8216;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&#8217; can transform a rabbit
into a rabbi. A literary critic might call this a &#8220;postmodern&#8221; 
magic, which dislocates language from what is &#8220;really&#8221; 
happening in the game. This is exceptionally hard to do well.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Games with magic in the authentic fantasy sense seldom follow the austere 
example of Tolkien, where &#8211; although there are spells, as where 
Gandalf sets light to fir cones in (the book) <i>The Hobbit</i> &#8211; 
the sign of a wizard is more often a priest-like ability to question
out motives in what people say and a sage-like wisdom about nature 
and history. Instead, perhaps for easy parsing and convenient subdivision 
and perhaps simply to imitate Gary Gygax's role-playing game <i>Dungeons 
and Dragons</i>, interactive fiction has 
<a id="p380" name="p380"></a>
tended to follow the <i>Dying Earth</i> stories (c. 1950) of Jack Vance<a id="s48_fnref1"
name="s48_fnref1"></a><a href="#s48_fn1">&#8224;</a> where spells are at
once dramatic flourishes, complex mental exercises which must be memorised, 
and highly specific tools with outr&eacute; names like &#8220;Xarfaggio's 
Physical Malepsy&#8221; and &#8220;The Excellent Prismatic Spray&#8221;. 
Many schemes of magic have been tried, and naturally each designer 
wants to find a new one. Sometimes spells take place in the mind (&#8216;Enchanter&#8217;), 
sometimes with the aid of certain objects (&#8216;Curses&#8217;); 
sometimes halfway between (Level 9's &#8216;Magik&#8217; games, David 
Williamson and Pete Austin, 1985&#8211;6). Keying magic to objects is 
advantageous because objects are tactile and part of the game's other 
play. In other respects, too, magic needs to be subject to the discipline 
of being easily subdivided and described. &#8220;Change a belt or staff 
into a small poisonous serpent&#8221; is far more amenable to designing 
(and parsing) than &#8220;convert up to 1000 cubic feet of rock to 
mud or quicksand&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
If the map is very large, or a good deal of moving to-and-fro is called 
for, designers have frequently used magic to provide rapid transport: such 
as the magic words in &#8216;Advent&#8217;, or the eight colour-coded 
collars in &#8216;Dungeon Adventure&#8217;, or the teleport booths 
in &#8216;Planetfall&#8217; (Steve Meretzky, 1983), or the black and 
white dots in &#8216;Adventure Quest&#8217; (Mike, Nick and Pete Austin, 
1984, 1983). Finding and deducing how to use this transport system can 
be a puzzle in itself, one whose solution is optional but rewarding.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">2. <i>Narrator and protagonist.</i>&nbsp;
Some narrators behave like a French &#8220;new novelist&#8221;, reporting 
only what the protagonist is currently seeing and doing. Others 
enjoy access to what the protagonist thinks and believes:</p>

<p class="output">Aunt Jemima has two cats, Jane and Austin, but she 
finds Austin especially annoying &#8211; this ought to make Austin your 
natural ally, but as it is you tend to glower at each other.</p>

<p class="normal">Here the narrator of &#8216;Curses&#8217; (Graham 
Nelson, 1993) tells the player that the protagonist doesn't like somebody. 
In a different game this could have been established by events, showing 
rather than telling. Indeed, the protagonist's relationship with Austin 
might have been neutral until established by the player's choices.</p>

<p class="indent">It is the narrator who speaks the game's opening words, 
sometimes called the &#8220;overture&#8221; and conventionally used 
to say what sort of person the protagonist is, and what he or she is 
trying to do. Overtures vary widely in how direct and indeed how honest 
they are. Many, like &#8216;Curses&#8217;, leave the player guessing 
or misdirect as a form of tease. This is a reaction against the overture
style of the 1980s, exemplified by &#8216;Snowball&#8217; (original 
version):</p>

<a id="p381" name="p381"></a>
<p class="output">The interstar freezer, Snowball 9, has entered its 
target starsystem. And it will soon enter the star unless you can do 
something!</p>

<p class="normal">Such directness was itself a necessity considering that 
players of the day expected any game to be a treasure hunt unless they 
were told otherwise. The overtures to quest games became highly predictable: 
here is &#8216;Enchanter&#8217; (Marc Blank and Dave Lebling, 1983):</p>

<p class="output">You, a novice Enchanter with but a few simple spells 
in your Book, must seek out Krill, explore the Castle he has overthrown, 
and learn his secrets. Only then may his vast evil&#8230;</p>

<p class="normal">And so on and so forth. What makes such briefings 
disappointing is partly that they often run on far too long and are 
full of words like &#8220;dread&#8221; and &#8220;imbue&#8221;,
and either take themselves very seriously or, which is worse, don't. 
Here is about a quarter of the &#8220;overture&#8221;, or opening 
text, of &#8216;Beyond Zork&#8217; (Brian Moriarty, 1987), a game 
not meant as a comedy:</p>

<p class="output">Y'Gael's dry chuckle stilled the murmur of the 
crowd. &#8220;You forget your own history, Gustar. Are you not author 
of the definitive scroll on the Coconut of Quendor?&#8221;<br>
A tumult of amphibious croaks and squeals drowned out Gustar's retort.
Y'Gael hobbled over to a table laden with mystical artifacts, selected 
a small stone and raised it high.<br>
&#8220;The Coconut is our only hope,&#8221; she cried, her eyes shining 
in the stone's violet aura. &#8220;Its seed embodies the essence of 
our wisdom. Its shell is impervious to the ravages of Time. We must 
reclaim it from the Implementors, and hide it away before its secrets 
are forgotten!&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">Self-indulgent, self-parodying, slack, told in the 
past tense, uninteractive and basically dumb. If Moriarty felt that 
the quest of the game was hackneyed, a better response would have been 
to restructure the game, not to allow the narrator to show disdain for 
it. The same author's overture to &#8216;Trinity&#8217; was by contrast 
honed to perfection:</p>

<p class="output">Sharp words between the superpowers. Tanks in East 
Berlin. And now, reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite blackout. 
It's enough to spoil your continental breakfast.<br>
But the world will have to wait. This is the last day of your $599 
London Getaway Package, and you're determined to soak up as much of 
that authentic English ambience as you can. So you've left the tour 
bus behind, ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park for a contemplative 
stroll through the Kensington Gardens.</p>

<p class="normal">A good deal has been achieved in these two paragraphs. 
Apart from details &#8211; mention of the BBC, of continental breakfasts, 
of the camera and the tour bus &#8211; you know who you are (an 
unadventurous American tourist, of no 
<a id="p382" name="p382"></a>
consequence to the world), where 
you are (Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, London, England), and what 
is going on in the world beyond (bad news: World War III is about to 
break out). Also, nobody knows where you've gone. In style, the opening 
of #8216;Trinity&#8217; is escapism from a disastrous world out of control, 
and notice the way the first paragraph is in tense, blunt, headline-like
sentences, whereas the second is much more relaxed. For a second example,
&#8216;Ballyhoo&#8217;:</p>

<p class="output">As you trudge along in the wake of the outflowing crowd, 
you thumb through your memories of this evening. Your experience of the 
circus, with its ballyhooed promises of wonderment and its ultimate 
disappointment, has been to sink your teeth into a candy apple whose 
fruit is rotten.<br>Never mind the outrageous prices, the Mt. Everest 
vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage 
than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances 
themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that 
the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal 
the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.</p>

<p class="normal">Many players will have no desire for any of that: 
but then the narrator is not talking about the player, only the 
protagonist.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
More detailed briefing information, if it is needed at all, can be 
placed interactively into the game &#8211; and not necessarily made 
available all at once: see the books in the library of &#8216;Christminster&#8217; 
(Gareth Rees, 1995).</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">3. <i>Player and narrator.</i>&nbsp;
The narrator chooses how much to tell the player and which scenes to 
show instead. When the game lapses into a cut-scene, a passage of 
text in which something happens which the player cannot interact with, 
it is because the narrator has chosen to override the player. Gareth 
Rees (Usenet posting 8/8/95):</p>

<blockquote>I decided not to use this technique, partly because I 
think it's an admission of defeat, a statement that the medium of 
adventure games is too inflexible to write the kind of character 
interaction we want to.</blockquote>

<p class="normal">Cut-scenes risk dislocating the player's engagement 
with the game, and the level of trust between player and narrator. By 
the end of a successful game, the narrator can take greater risks, taking 
advantage of friendship so to speak. At the start, and especially in 
the overture text, the narrator does well to avoid cut-scenes and 
presumptions. Thomas Nilsson advises designers to</p>

<blockquote>Create an image of him or it [the narrator] and stick to 
it. Receiving comments about your (limited) progress in the game might 
be funny, as long as they are not out of character.</blockquote>

<a id="p383" name="p383"></a>
<p class="normal">Indeed many narrators are self-effacing and unintrusive 
so long as the player pursues the &#8220;correct&#8221; line of choices, 
but immediately emerge as wry, sardonic or knowing once this line is 
deviated from. The tiniest phrases betray this:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>wave</tt><br>
You wave, but nobody waves back. Life's like that.</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>look behind hanging</tt><br>
Nope, no more keys.</p>

<p class="output">You are falling towards the ground, wind whipping around you.<br>
&gt;<tt>east</tt><br>
Down seems more likely.</p>

<p class="output">Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.<br>
&gt;<tt>austin, go south</tt><br>
I can see you've never had a cat.</p>

<p class="normal">&#8216;Kingdom of Hamil&#8217;; &#8216;Sorcerer&#8217;; 
&#8216;Spellbreaker&#8217;; &#8216;Curses&#8217;. It is no coincidence
that these responses are often jibes at the player's progress. Like 
the player, but unlike every character in the game (including the 
protagonist), the narrator knows that it <em>is</em> a game: it's the 
narrator who announces the rules, awards points and offers clues. The 
un-mimetic passage from &#8216;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&#8217; 
quoted in the previous section&#8230;</p>

<p class="output">Ford lowers his voice to a whisper. &#8220;I'm not 
supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish the game 
without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">&#8230;is funny (if it is) because Ford is usurping 
the narrator. Nobody would turn a hair at the more conventional 
alternative:</p>

<p class="output">Ford hands over the book and turns away.<br>
[Please type &#8220;consult guide about stuff&#8221; to look up its 
entry on &#8220;stuff&#8221;, and so on.]</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed in some games it might be said that the parser, 
who asks questions like &#8220;Which do you mean&#8230;?&#8221; and 
in some games speaks only in square brackets, is a fourth character, 
quite different from the narrator.</p>

<p class="indent">Playing games with the narrator is one of Steve Meretzky's 
favourite comic techniques. Here is a more moderate, more typical example:</p>

<p class="output">(It's no wonder this section of Mars is considered the 
Ruined Castle Capital of the Solar System.)</p>

<p class="normal">More moderate, yet even in &#8216;Leather Goddesses 
of Phobos&#8217; such a remark feels the need for parentheses. It is 
only in parody that the narrator goes in for commentary full-time.</p>

<a id="p384" name="p384"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
This is a common tactic for designers of juvenile or silly games, who 
hope thereby to suggest that because the game is knowing about its 
shortcomings it is therefore more sophisticated, more mature. But 
it seldom is. Cf. the numerous &#8216;Zork&#8217; pastiches which
were intended to be parodies, or Big Al's &#8216;BJ Drifter&#8217; 
(1998).</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
For surveys of the quite extensive range of approaches to player identity 
in the canonical games, see &#8216;Character Gender in Interactive 
Fiction&#8217;, parts I and II, by Doug Anderson (<i>XYZZYnews</i> 
3 and 6) and &#8216;Player Character Identity in IF&#8217;, John Wood 
(<i>XYZZYnews</i> 9). Notable gender ambiguities include the &#8216;Snowball&#8217; 
trilogy, whose protagonist is one Kim Kimberley, and &#8216;Jigsaw&#8217;, 
which attempts a romantic sub-plot without specified genders on either 
part. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>In later life, W. H. Auden (1907&#8211;73) 
considered the ghostly identity narrating a poem to be one of its two

technical: &#8216;Here is a verbal contraption. How does it work?&#8217;

<P>

<PRE>
Object medicine "guaranteed child-proof medicine bottle" cupboard
  with name "medicine" "bottle",
       description "~Antidote only: no preventative effect.~",
       openup
       [;  give self open ~locked; "The bottle cracks open!";
       ],
  has  container openable locked;
</PRE>

Any other code in the game can send the message <TT>medicine.openup()</TT>
to crack open the bottle.  For brevity, this solution assumes that
the bottle is always visible to the player when it is opened -- if not
the printed message will be incongruous.

<blockquote>As some day it may happen that a victim must be found<br>

Of society offenders who might well be underground,<br>
And who never would be missed<br>

Listing objects tidily in a grammatical sentence is more difficult
than it seems, especially when taking plurals and groups of similar
objects into account. Here, for instance, is a list of 23 items printed
by a room description in the demonstration game &#8216;List Property&#8217;:</p>

<p class="output">You can see a plastic fork, knife and spoon, three 
hats (a fez, a Panama and a sombrero), the letters X, Y, Z, P, Q and 
R from a Scrabble set, Punch magazine, a recent issue of the Spectator, 
a die and eight coins (four silver, one bronze and three gold) here.</p>

<p class="normal">Fortunately, the library's list-maker is available 
to the public by calling:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">WriteListFrom(object, style);</pre>

<p class="normal">where the list will start from the given object and 
go along its siblings. Thus, to list all the objects inside <code>X</code>, 
list from <code>child(X)</code>. What the list looks like depends on 
a &#8220;style&#8221; made by adding up some of the following:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table style="margin-left:30px;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em">
<tr><td><code>ALWAYS_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Always recurse downwards</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>CONCEAL_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Misses out <code>concealed</code> or <code>scenery</code> objects</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>DEFART_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Uses the definite article in list</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ENGLISH_BIT</code></td>
 <td>English sentence style, with commas and &#8216;and&#8217;</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>FULLINV_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Gives full inventory entry for each object</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>INDENT_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Indents each entry according to depth</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ISARE_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Prints &#8220; is &#8221; or &#8220; are &#8221; before list</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NEWLINE_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Prints new-line after each entry</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NOARTICLE_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Prints no articles, definite or indefinite</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>PARTINV_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Only brief inventory information after entry</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>RECURSE_BIT</code></td>
 <td>Recurses downwards with usual rules</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>TERSE_BIT</code></td>
 <td>More terse English style</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>WORKFLAG_BIT</code></td>
 <td>At top level (only), only lists objects which have 
 the <code>workflag</code> attribute</td></tr>
</table>

<a id="p212" name="p212"></a>
<p class="normal">Recursing downwards means that if an object is listed, 
then its children are also listed, and so on for their children. 
The &#8220;usual rules&#8221; of <code>RECURSE_BIT</code> are that 
children are only listed if the parent is <code>transparent</code>, 
or a <code>supporter</code>, or a <code>container</code> which is 
<code>open</code> &#8211; which is the definition of 
&#8220;see-through&#8221; used throughout the Inform library. &#8220;Full 
inventory information&#8221; means listing objects exactly as if in 
an inventory, according to the rigmarole described in
<a href="s26.html">&#167;26</a>. &#8220;Brief inventory information&#8221; 
means listing as if in a room description: that is, noting whether objects 
are open, closed, empty or providing light (except that light is 
only mentioned when in a room which is normally dark).</p>

<p class="indent">The best way to decide which bits to set is to experiment. 
For example, a &#8216;tall&#8217; inventory is produced by:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
WriteListFrom(child(player),
    FULLINV_BIT + INDENT_BIT + NEWLINE_BIT + RECURSE_BIT);
</pre>

<p class="normal">and a &#8216;wide&#8217; one by:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
WriteListFrom(child(player),
    FULLINV_BIT + ENGLISH_BIT + RECURSE_BIT);
</pre>

<p class="normal">which produce effects like:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>inventory tall</tt><br>
You are carrying:<br>
&nbsp; a bag (which is open)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; three gold coins<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; two silver coins<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; a bronze coin<br>
&nbsp; four featureless white cubes<br>
&nbsp; a magic burin<br>
&nbsp; a spell book<br>
&gt;<tt>inventory wide</tt><br>
You are carrying a bag (which is open), inside which are three gold coins, 
two silver coins and a bronze coin, four featureless white cubes, a 
magic burin and a spell book.</p>

<p class="normal">except that the &#8220;You are carrying&#8221; part 
is not done by the list-maker, and nor is the final full stop in the 
second example.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The <code>workflag</code> is an attribute which the library scribbles 
over from time to time as temporary storage, but you can use it for 
short periods with care. In this case it makes it possible to specify 
any reasonable list.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
<code>WORKFLAG_BIT</code> and <code>CONCEAL_BIT</code> specify 
conflicting rules. If they're both given, then what happens is: at 
the top level, but not below, everything with <code>workflag</code> is
included; on lower levels, but not at the top, everything without 
<code>concealed</code> or <code>scenery</code> is included.</p>

<a id="p213" name="p213"></a>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans66">EXERCISE 66</a></b></span><br>
Write a <code>DoubleInvSub</code> action routine to produce an inventory 
like so:</p>

<p class="output">You are carrying four featureless white cubes, a 
magic burin and a spell book. In addition, you are wearing a purple 
cloak and a miner's helmet.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Lists are shorter, neater and more elegantly phrased 
if similar objects are grouped together. For instance, keys, books 
and torch batteries are all grouped together in lists printed by the 
game &#8216;Curses&#8217;. To achieve this, the objects belonging to 
such a group (all the keys for instance) provide a common value of 
the property <code>list_together</code>. If this value is a number 
between 1 and 1000, the library will unobtrusively group the objects 
with that value together so that they appear consecutively in any 
list. For instance &#8216;Curses&#8217; includes the following 
definitions:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Constant KEY_GROUP = 1;
...
Object -&gt; -&gt; brass_key &quot;small brass key&quot;
  with ...
       list_together KEY_GROUP;
</pre>

<p class="normal">and similarly for the other keys. Alternatively, instead 
of being a small number the common value can be a string such as 
<code>&quot;foodstuffs&quot;</code>. If so, then it must either 
be given in a class definition or else as a constant, like so:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">Constant FOOD_GROUP = &quot;foodstuffs&quot;;</pre>

<p class="normal">(In particular, the actual text should only be written 
out in one place in the source code. Otherwise two or more different 
strings will be made, which just happen to have the same text as each 
other, and Inform will consider these to be different values of 
<code>list_together</code>.) Lists will then cite, for instance,</p>

<p class="output">three foodstuffs (a scarlet fish, some lembas wafer 
and an onion)</p>

<p class="normal">in running text, or</p>

<p class="output">three foodstuffs:<br>
&nbsp; a scarlet fish<br>
&nbsp; some lembas wafer<br>
&nbsp; an onion</p>

<a id="p214" name="p214"></a>
<p class="normal">in indented lists. This only happens when two or 
more are gathered together. Finally, the common value of <code>list_together</code> 
can be a routine, such as:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
list_together [;
    if (inventory_stage == 1) {
        print &quot;heaps of food, notably&quot;;
        if (c_style &amp; INDENT_BIT == 0) print &quot; &quot;;
            else print &quot; --^&quot;;
    } else if (c_style &amp; INDENT_BIT == 0)
        print &quot; (which only reminds you how hungry you are)&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">Typically this might be part of a class definition from 
which all the objects in question inherit. Any <code>list_together</code> 
routine will be called twice: once, with <code>inventory_stage</code> 
set to 1, as a preamble to the list of items, and once (with 2) to 
print any postscript required. It is allowed to change <code>c_style</code>, 
the current list style, without needing to restore the old value and 
may, by returning <code>true</code> from stage 1, signal the list-maker 
not to print a list at all. The above example would give a conversational 
sentence-like list as follows:</p>

<p class="output">heaps of food, notably a scarlet fish, some lembas 
wafer and an onion (which only reminds you how hungry you are)</p>

<p class="normal">and would also look suitable in sober tall-inventory-like 
columns:</p>

<p class="output">heaps of food, notably --<br>
&nbsp; a scarlet fish<br>
&nbsp; some lembas wafer<br>
&nbsp; an onion</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
A <code>list_together</code> routine has the opportunity to look through 
the objects which are about to be listed together, by looking at some 
of the list-maker's variables. <code>parser_one</code> holds the first 
object in the group and <code>parser_two</code> holds the depth of
recursion in the list, which might be needed to keep the indentation 
straight. Applying <code>x = NextEntry(x,parser_two)</code> will move 
<code>x</code> on from one object to the next in the group being 
listed.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
The library variable <code>listing_together</code> is set to the first 
object of a group being listed, when a group is being listed, or to 
<code>nothing</code> the rest of the time. This is useful because 
an object's <code>short_name</code> routine might need to behave 
differently during a grouped listing to the rest of the time.</p>

Design a class called <code>AlphaSorted</code>, members of which are always 
listed in alphabetical order. Although this <em>could</em> be done 
with <code>list_together</code>, this exercise is here to draw the 
reader's attention to an ugly but sometimes useful alternative. The 
only actions likely to produce lists are <code>Look</code>, <code>Search</code>, 
<code>Open</code> and <code>Inv</code>: so react to these actions by
rearranging the object tree into alphabetical order before the 
list-writer gets going.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b>REFERENCES</b></span><br>
A good example of <code>WriteListFrom</code> in action is the definition 
of <code>CarryingClass</code> from the example game &#8216;The 
Thief&#8217;, by Gareth Rees. This alters the examine description of
a character by appending a list of what that person is carrying and 
wearing. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Andreas Hoppler has written an 
alternative list-writing library extension called <tt>&quot;Lister.h&quot;</tt>,
which defines a class <code>Lister</code> so that designers can customise 
their own listing engines for different purposes in a single game. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>Anson Turner's example program 
<tt>&quot;52.inf&quot;</tt> models a deck of cards, and an extensive 
<code>list_together</code> sorts out hands of cards.</p>

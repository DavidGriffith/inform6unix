Living creatures should be given the attribute <code>animate</code> so that the
library knows such an object can be talked to, given things, woken from 
sleep and so on. When the player treats an <code>animate</code> object 
as living in this way, the library calls upon that object's <code>life</code> property.
This looks like <code>before</code> or <code>after</code>, but only 
applies to the following actions:</p>

<div class="inset"><dl>
<dt><code>Attack</code></dt><dd>The player is making hostile advances&#8230;</dd>
<dt><code>Kiss</code></dt><dd>&#8230; or amorous ones&#8230;</dd> 
<dt><code>WakeOther</code></dt><dd>&#8230; or simply trying to rouse the creature from sleep.</dd>
<dt><code>ThrowAt</code></dt><dd>The player asked to throw <code>noun</code> at the creature.</dd>
<dt><code>Give</code></dt><dd>The player asked to give <code>noun</code> to the creature&#8230;</dd>
<dt><code>Show</code></dt><dd>&#8230; or, tantalisingly, just to show it.</dd>
<dt><code>Ask</code></dt><dd>The player asked about something. Just as with a 
&#8220;consult&#8221; topic (see <a href="s16.html">&#167;16</a> 
above), the variables <code>consult_from</code> and <code>consult_words</code>
are set up to indicate which words the object might like to think
about. (In addition, <code>second</code> holds the dictionary value 
for the first word which isn't <tt>'the'</tt>, but this is much 
cruder.)</dd>
<dt><code>Tell</code></dt><dd>The player is trying to tell the creature about 
something. The topic is set up just as for <code>Ask</code> (that 
is, <code>consult_from</code> and <code>consult_words</code> are 
set, and <code>second</code> also holds the first interesting
word).</dd>
<dt><code>Answer</code></dt><dd>This can happen in two ways. One is if the player 
types &#8220;answer some text to troll&quot; or &#8220;say some text 
to troll&#8221;; the other is if an order is given which the parser 
can't sort out, such as &#8220;troll, og south&quot;, and which the 
<code>orders</code> property hasn't handled already. Once again, 
variables are set as if it were a &#8220;consult&#8221; topic. 
(In addition, <code>noun</code> is set to the first word, and an 
attempt to read the text as a number is stored in the variable 
<code>special_number</code>: for instance, &#8220;computer, 143&#8221; 
will cause <code>special_number</code> to be set to 143.)</dd>
<dt><code>Order</code></dt><dd>This catches any &#8216;orders&#8217; which 
aren't handled by the <code>orders</code> property (see the next 
section); <code>action</code>, <code>noun</code> and <code>second</code> 
are set up as usual.</dd>
</dl></div>

<p class="normal">If the <code>life</code> rule isn't given, or 
returns <code>false</code>, events take their usual course.
<code>life</code> rules vary dramatically in size. The coiled snake 
from &#8216;Balances&#8217; shows that even the tiniest <code>life</code> 
routine can be adequate for an animal:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object -&gt; snake &quot;hissing snake&quot;
  with name 'hissing' 'snake',
       initial &quot;Tightly coiled at the edge of the chasm is a
           hissing snake.&quot;,
       life &quot;The snake hisses angrily!&quot;,
  has  animate;
</pre>

<p class="normal">It's far from unknown for people in interactive 
fiction to be almost as simplistic as that, but in most games even 
relatively passive characters have some ability to speak or react. 
Here is the funerary priest standing in the &#8216;Ruins&#8217; Shrine:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
Object priest &quot;mummified priest&quot;
  with name 'mummified' 'priest',
       description
           &quot;He is desiccated and hangs together only by will-power.
           Though his first language is presumably local Mayan,
           you have the curious instinct that he will understand
           your speech.&quot;,
       initial &quot;Behind the slab, a mummified priest stands waiting,
           barely alive at best, impossibly venerable.&quot;,
       life [;
           Answer: &quot;The priest coughs, and almost falls apart.&quot;;
           Ask: switch (second) {
               'dictionary', 'book':
                   if (dictionary.correct == false)
                       &quot;~The ~bird~ glyph... very funny.~&quot;;
                   &quot;~A dictionary? Really?~&quot;;
               'glyph', 'glyphs', 'mayan', 'dialect':
                   &quot;~In our culture, the Priests are ever
                   literate.~&quot;;
               'lord', 'tomb', 'shrine', 'temple':
                   &quot;~This is a private matter.~&quot;;
               'ruins': &quot;~The ruins will ever defeat thieves.
                   In the underworld, looters are tortured
                   throughout eternity.~ A pause. ~As are
                   archaeologists.~&quot;;<a id="p146" name="p146"></a>
               'web', 'wormcast':
                   &quot;~No man can pass the Wormcast.~&quot;;
               'xibalba': if (Shrine.sw_to == Junction)
                       &quot;The priest shakes his bony finger.&quot;;
                   Shrine.sw_to = Junction;
                   &quot;The priest extends one bony finger
                   southwest toward the icicles, which
                   vanish like frost as he speaks.
                   ~Xibalb@'a, the Underworld.~&quot;;
               }
               &quot;~You must find your own answer.~&quot;;
           Tell: &quot;The priest has no interest in your sordid life.&quot;;
           Attack, Kiss:
               remove self;
               &quot;The priest desiccates away into dust until nothing
               remains, not a breeze nor a bone.&quot;;
           ThrowAt: move noun to location; &lt;&lt;Attack self&gt;&gt;;
           Show, Give:
               if (noun == dictionary &amp;&amp; dictionary.correct == false) {
                   dictionary.correct = true;
                   &quot;The priest reads a little of the book, laughing
                   in a hollow, whispering way. Unable to restrain
                   his mirth, he scratches in a correction somewhere
                   before returning the book.&quot;;
               }
               &quot;The priest is not interested in earthly things.&quot;;
       ],
  has  animate;
</pre>

<p class="normal">The Priest only stands and waits, but some 
characters need to move around, or to appear and reappear throughout 
a game, changing in their responses and what they know. This makes 
for a verbose object definition full of cross-references to 
items and places scattered across the source code. An 
alternative is to use different objects to represent the character 
at different times or places: in &#8216;Jigsaw&#8217;, for instance, 
the person called &#8220;Black&#8221; is seven different objects.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Animate objects representing people with proper 
names, like &#8220;Mark Antony&#8221;, need to be given the <code>proper</code> 
attribute, and those with feminine names, such as &#8220;Cleopatra&#8221;, 
need to be both <code>female</code> and <code>proper</code>, 
though of course history would have been very different if&#8230; 
Inanimate objects sometimes have proper names, too: Waldeck's 
Mayan dictionary in <a href="s16.html">&#167;16</a> was given 
<code>proper</code>. See <a href="s26.html">&#167;26</a> for
more on naming.</p>

<a id="p147" name="p147"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Some objects are not alive as such, but can still 
be spoken to: microphones, tape recorders and so on. It would be 
a nuisance to implement these as <code>animate</code>, since 
they have none of the other characteristics of life. Instead,
they can be given just the attribute <code>talkable</code>, making 
them responsive only to conversation. They have a <code>life</code> property 
to handle <code>Answer</code> and so on, but it will never be asked 
to deal with, for instance, <code>Kiss</code>. Talkable objects can 
also receive orders: see the next section.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Designers often imagine animate objects as 
being altogether different from things, so it's worth noting that 
all the usual Inform rules apply equally well to the living. An 
<code>animate</code> object still has <code>before</code> and 
<code>after</code> routines like any other, so the short list of 
possible <code>life</code> rules is not as restrictive as it appears.
Animate objects can also <code>react_before</code> and 
<code>react_after</code>, and it's here that these properties really 
come into their own:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
react_before [;
    Drop: if (noun == satellite_gadget)
        print &quot;~I wouldn't do that, Mr Bond,~ says Blofeld.^^&quot;;
    Shoot: remove beretta;
        &quot;As you draw, Blofeld snaps his fingers and a giant
        magnet snatches the gun from your hand. It hits the
        ceiling with a clang. Blofeld silkily strokes his cat.&quot;;
];
</pre>

<p class="normal">If Blofeld moves from place to place, these rules 
usefully move with him.</p>

<p class="indent">Animate objects often have possessions as part 
of the game design. Two examples, both from &#8216;The Lurking 
Horror&#8217;:</p>

<ul>
<li>an urchin with something bulging inside his jacket pocket;</li>
<li>a hacker who has a bunch of keys hanging off his belt.</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">Recall from <a href="s12.html">&#167;12</a> 
that the child-objects of an object which isn't a <code>container</code>
or <code>supporter</code> are outwardly visible only if the object 
has the <code>transparent</code> attribute. Here, the hacker should 
have <code>transparent</code> and the urchin not. The parser then 
prevents the player from referring to whatever the urchin is hiding,
even if the player has played the game before and knows what is 
in there.</p>

<b><a href="sa6.html#ans26">EXERCISE 26</a></b></span><br>
Arrange for a bearded psychiatrist to place the player under observation, 
occasionally mumbling insights such as &#8220;Subject puts green 
cone on table. Interesting.&#8221;</p>

<h2>&#167;26 &nbsp; Describing objects and rooms</h2>

<p class="normal"><span class="atleft"><img src="dm4-204_1.jpg" alt=""></span>
Talking about the state of the world is much easier than listening
to the player's intentions for it. Despite this, the business of
description takes up a fair part of this chapter since the designer of a
really complex game will eventually need to know almost every rule
involved. (Whereas nobody would want to know everything about the parser.)</p>

<p class="indent">The simplest description of an object is its &#8220;short name&#8221;. 
For instance,</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">print (a) brass_lamp;</pre>

<p class="normal">may result in &#8220;an old brass lamp&#8221; being 
printed. There are four such forms of <code>print</code>:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<table style="margin-left:30px;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em">
<tr><td><code>print (the) obj</code></td>
 <td>&nbsp; Print the object with its definite article</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>print (The) obj</code></td>
 <td>&nbsp; The same, but capitalised</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>print (a) obj</code></td>
 <td>&nbsp; Print the object with indefinite article</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>print (name) obj</code></td>
 <td>&nbsp; Print the object's short name alone</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="normal">and these can be freely mixed into lists of things 
to <code>print</code> or <code>print_ret</code>, as for example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">&quot;The ogre declines to eat &quot;, (the) noun, &quot;.&quot;;</pre>

<a id="ex62" name="ex62"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans62">EXERCISE 62</a></b></span><br>
When referring to <code>animate</code> objects, you sometimes need to 
use pronouns such as &#8220;him&#8221;. Define new printing routines 
so that <code>print &quot;You throw the book at &quot;, (PronounAcc) obj, 
&quot;!&quot;;</code> will insert the right accusative pronouns.</p>

<a id="p205" name="p205"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
There is also a special syntax <code>print (object)</code> for printing 
object names, but <em>do not use it without good reason</em>: it 
doesn't understand some of the features below and is not protected 
against crashing if you mistakenly try to print the name for an object 
that doesn't exist.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">Inform tries to work out the right indefinite article 
for any object automatically. In English-language games, it uses &#8216;an&#8217; 
when the short name starts with a vowel and &#8216;a&#8217; when 
it does not (unless the name is plural, when &#8216;some&#8217; is used 
in either case). You can override this by setting <code>article</code> 
yourself, either to some text or a routine to print some. Here are 
some possibilities, arranged as &#8220;article / name&#8221;:</p>

<p class="output">&#8220;a / platinum bar&#8221;, &#8220;an 
/ orange balloon&#8221;, &#8220;your / Aunt Jemima&#8221;,<br>
&#8220;some bundles of / reeds&#8221;, &#8220;far too many / marbles&#8221;,<br>
&#8220;The / London Planetarium&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">If the object is given the attribute <code>proper</code> then 
its name is treated as a proper noun taking no article, so the value 
of article is ignored. Objects representing named people usually have 
<code>proper</code>, and so might a book like &#8220;Whitaker's 
Almanac&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent">Definite articles are always &#8220;the&#8221;, except 
for <code>proper</code> nouns. Thus</p>

<p class="output">&#8220;the / platinum bar&#8221;, &#8220;Benjamin 
Franklin&#8221;, &#8220;Elbereth&#8221;</p>

<p class="normal">are all printed by <code>print (the) ...</code>, the 
latter two objects being <code>proper</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">A single object whose name is plural, such as 
&#8220;grapes&#8221; or &#8220;marble pillars&#8221;, should 
be given the attribute <code>pluralname</code>. As a result the library 
might say, e.g., &#8220;You can't open those&#8221; instead of &#8220;You 
can't open that&#8221;. As mentioned above, the indefinite article 
becomes &#8220;some&#8221;, and the player can use the pronoun 
&#8220;them&#8221; to refer to the object, so for instance &#8220;take 
them&#8221; to pick up the grapes-object.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
You can give <code>animate</code> objects the attributes <code>male</code>, 
<code>female</code> or <code>neuter</code> to help the parser understand 
pronouns properly. <code>animate</code> objects are assumed to be 
male if you set neither alternative.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
There's usually no need to worry about definite and indefinite articles 
for room objects, as the standard Inform rules never print them.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<a id="p206" name="p206"></a>
<p class="normal">The short name of an object is normally the text given 
in double-quotes at the head of its definition. This is very inconvenient 
to change during play when, for example, &#8220;blue liquid&#8221; 
becomes &#8220;purple liquid&#8221; as a result of a chemical reaction. 
A more flexible way to specify an object's short name is with the
<code>short_name</code> property. To print the name of such an object, 
Inform does the following:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(1) If the <code>short_name</code> is a string, it's printed and 
that's all.</li>
<li>(2) If it is a routine, then it is called. If it returns 
<code>true</code>, that's all.</li>
<li>(3) The text given in the header of the object definition is 
printed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="normal">For example, the dye might be defined with:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
short_name [;
    switch(self.colour) {
        1: print &quot;blue &quot;;
        2: print &quot;purple &quot;;
        3: print &quot;horrid sludge&quot;; rtrue;
    }
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">with <code>&quot;liquid&quot;</code> as the 
short name in its header. According to whether its <code>colour</code>
property is 1, 2 or 3, the printed result is &#8220;blue liquid&#8221;, 
&#8220;purple liquid&#8221; or &#8220;horrid sludge&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Alternatively, define the dye with <code>short_name &quot;blue liquid&quot;</code> 
and then simply execute <code>dye.short_name = &quot;purple liquid&quot;;</code> 
when the time comes.</p>

<a id="ex63" name="ex63"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans63">EXERCISE 63</a></b></span><br>
Design a chessboard of sixty-four locations with a map corresponding to 
an eight-by-eight grid, so that White advances north towards Black, with 
pieces placed on the board according to a game position. Hint: using 
flexible routines for <code>short_name</code>, this can be done with 
just two objects, one representing all sixty-four squares, the other
representing all thirty-two pieces.</p>

<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">For many objects the indefinite article and short 
name will most often be seen in inventory lists, such as:</p>

<p class="output">&gt;<tt>inventory</tt><br>
You are carrying:<br>
&nbsp; a leaf of mint<br>
&nbsp; a peculiar book<br>
&nbsp; your satchel (which is open)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; a green cube</p>

<a id="p207" name="p207"></a>
<p class="normal">Some objects, though, ought to have fuller entries 
in an inventory: a wine bottle should say how much wine is left, 
for instance. The <code>invent</code> property is designed for this. 
The simplest way to use <code>invent</code> is as a string. For 
instance, declaring a peculiar book with</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">invent &quot;that harmless old book of Geoffrey's&quot;,</pre>

<p class="normal">will make this the inventory line for the book. In 
the light of events, it could later be changed with a statement like:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">book.invent = &quot;that lethal old book of Geoffrey's&quot;;</pre>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Note that this string becomes the whole inventory entry: if the object 
were an open container, its contents wouldn't be listed, which might 
be unfortunate. In such circumstances it's better to write an <code>invent</code> 
routine, and that's also the way to append text like &#8220;(half-empty)&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Each line of an inventory is produced in two stages. <em>First</em>, 
the basic line:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(1a) The global variable <code>inventory_stage</code> is set to 1.</li>
<li>(1b) The <code>invent</code> routine is called (if there is one). 
If it returns true, stop here.</li>
<li>(1c) The object's indefinite article and short-name are printed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="aside"><em>Second</em>, little informative messages like 
&#8220;(which is open)&quot; are printed, and inventories are given 
for the contents of open containers:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(2a) The global variable <code>inventory_stage</code> is set 
to 2.</li>
<li>(2b) The <code>invent</code> routine is called (if there is one). 
If it returns true, stop here.</li>
<li>(2c) A message such as &#8220;(closed, empty and providing light)&#8221; 
is printed, as appropriate.</li>
<li>(2d) If it is an <code>open container</code>, or a <code>supporter</code>, 
or is <code>transparent</code>, then its contents are inventoried.</li>
</ul>

<p class="aside">After each line is printed, linking text such as a new-line 
or a comma is printed, according to the current &#8220;list style&#8221;.</p>

<p class="aside">For example, here is the <code>invent</code> routine 
used by the matchbook in &#8216;Toyshop&#8217;:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
invent [ i;
    if (inventory_stage == 2) {
        i = self.number;
        if (i == 0) print &quot; (empty)&quot;;
        if (i == 1) print &quot; (1 match left)&quot;;
        if (i &gt; 1)  print &quot; (&quot;, i, &quot; matches left)&quot;;
     }
],
</pre>

<a id="ex64" name="ex64"></a>
<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>&#9650;&#9650;
<b><a href="sa6.html#ans64">EXERCISE 64</a></b></span><br>
Suppose you want to change the whole inventory line for an ornate box 
but you can't use an <code>invent</code> string, or return true from 
stage 1, because you still want stage 2d to happen properly (so that 
its contents will be listed). How can you achieve this?</p>

<a id="p208" name="p208"></a>
<p class="dotbreak">· · · · ·</p>

<p class="normal">The largest and most complicated messages the Inform 
library ever prints on its own initiative are room descriptions, printed 
when the <code>Look</code> action is carried out (for instance, when 
the statement <code>&lt;Look&gt;;</code> triggers a room description).
What happens is: the room's short name is printed, usually emphasised 
in bold-face, then the <code>description</code>, followed by a list of 
the objects residing there which aren't <code>concealed</code> or 
<code>scenery</code>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="ch3.html">Chapter III</a> mentioned many 
different properties &#8211; <code>initial</code>, <code>when_on</code>,
<code>when_off</code> and so on &#8211; giving descriptions of what 
an object looks like when in the same room as the player: some apply 
to doors, others to switchable objects and so on. All of them can be 
routines to print text, instead of being strings to print. The precise 
rules are given below.</p>

<p class="indent">But the whole system can be bypassed using the 
<code>describe</code> property. If an object gives a <code>describe</code>
routine then this takes priority over everything: if it returns 
<code>true</code>, the library assumes that the object has already been 
described, and prints nothing further. For example:</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
describe [;
    &quot;^The platinum pyramid catches the light beautifully.&quot;;
],
</pre>

<p class="normal">Unlike an <code>initial</code> description, this is 
still seen even if the pyramid has moved, i.e., been held by the 
player at some stage.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Note the initial <code>^</code> (new-line) character. The library doesn't 
print a skipped line itself before calling <code>describe</code> because 
it doesn't know yet whether the routine will want to say anything. 
A <code>describe</code> routine which prints nothing and returns true 
makes an object invisible, as if it were <code>concealed</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Here is exactly how a room description is printed. Recall from 
<a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a> that <code>location</code> holds the 
player's location if there is light, and <code>thedark</code> if not, 
and see <a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a> for the definition of 
&#8220;visibility ceiling&#8221;, which roughly means the outermost 
thing the player can see: normally the location, but possibly a closed 
opaque container which the player is inside. First the top line:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(1a) A new-line is printed. The short name of the visibility ceiling 
is printed, using emphasised type, which on most models of computer 
appears as bold face.</li>
<li>(1b) If the player is on a <code>supporter</code>, then 
&#8220; (on &#8249;<span class="token">something</span>&#8250;)&#8221; is printed; 
if inside something (other than the visibility ceiling), then 
&#8220; (in &#8249;<span class="token">something</span>&#8250;)&#8221;.</li>
<li>(1c) &#8220; (as &#8249;<span class="token">something</span>&#8250;)&#8221; 
is printed if this was requested by the game's most recent call to 
<code>ChangePlayer</code>: for instance, &#8220; (as a werewolf)&#8221;. 
(See <a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a> for details of <code>ChangePlayer</code>.)</li>
<li>(1d) A new-line is printed.</li>
</ul>

<a id="p209" name="p209"></a>
<p class="aside">Now the long description. This step is sometimes 
skipped, depending on which &#8220;look mode&#8221; the player has 
chosen: in the normal mode, it is skipped if the player has just moved 
by a <code>Go</code> action into a location already visited; in &#8220;superbrief&#8221; 
mode it is always skipped, while in &#8220;verbose&#8221; mode it is 
never skipped.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(2a) Starting with the visibility ceiling and working down through 
&#8220;levels&#8221; of <code>enterable</code> objects containing 
the player, a long description is printed, as follows:
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
 <li>If the level is the current value of <code>location</code>, 
 that is, the current room or else <code>thedark</code>, then: if 
 <code>location</code> provides <code>describe</code> then the message
 <code>location.describe()</code> is sent. If not, then 
 <code>location.description()</code> is sent. Every room is required 
 to provide one or the other. (This is now redundant. In earlier 
 Informs, <code>description</code> could only be a string, so
 <code>describe</code> was there in case a routine was needed.)</li>
 <li>If not, the level must be an enterable object <code>E</code>. 
 If <code>E</code> provides it, the message <code>E.inside_description()</code> 
 is sent.</li>
 </ol></li>
<li>(2b) After the description of each visibility level, the objects 
contained in that level are &#8220;listed&#8221; (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p class="aside">The library has now finished, but your game gets a chance 
to add a postscript by means of an entry point routine:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>(3) The entry point <code>LookRoutine</code> is called.</li>
</ul>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
Besides printing room descriptions, the <code>Look</code> action has 
side-effects: it can award the player some points, or mark a room 
with the attribute <code>visited</code>. For these rules in full, 
see <a href="s21.html">&#167;21</a>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
The <code>visited</code> attribute is only given to a room <em>after</em> its 
description has been printed for the first time. This is convenient 
for making the description different after the first time.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;&#9650;</span>
When &#8220;listing objects&#8221; (as in 3a and 3b above) some objects 
are given a paragraph to themselves, while others are lumped together 
in a list at the end. The following objects are not mentioned at all: 
the player; what the player is in or on (if anything), because this 
has been taken care of in the short or long description already; and
anything which has the attributes <code>scenery</code> or <code>concealed</code>. 
The remaining objects are looked through, eldest first, as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>If the object has a <code>describe</code> routine, run it. If 
it returns <code>true</code>, stop here and don't mention the object 
at all.</li>
<li>Work out the &#8220;description property&#8221; for the object:
 <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
 <li>For a <code>container</code>, this is <code>when_open</code> 
 or <code>when_closed</code>;</li>
 <li>Otherwise, for a <code>switchable</code> object this is 
 <code>when_on</code> or <code>when_off</code>;</li>
 <li>Otherwise, for a door this is <code>when_open</code> or 
 <code>when_closed</code>;</li>
 <li>Otherwise, it's <code>initial</code>.</li>
 </ol>
<li>If <em>either</em> the object doesn't provide this property <em>or</em> 
the object has <code>moved</code> and the property isn't <code>when_off</code> 
or <code>when_closed</code> <em>then</em> the object will be listed 
at the end, not given a paragraph of its own.</li>
<li><a id="p210" name="p210"></a>Otherwise a new-line is printed and the property is printed (if 
it's a string) or run (if it's a routine). If it is a routine, it 
had better print something, as otherwise there will be a spurious blank 
line in the room description.</li>
</ol>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Note that although a <code>supporter</code> which is <code>scenery</code> 
won't be mentioned, anything on top of it may well be. If this 
is undesirable, set these objects on top to be <code>concealed</code>.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
Objects which have just been pushed into a new room are not listed in 
that room's description on the turn in question. This is not because 
of any rule about room descriptions, but because the pushed object is 
moved into the new room only after the room description is made. This 
means that when a wheelbarrow is pushed for a long distance, the player 
does not have to keep reading &#8220;You can see a wheelbarrow here.&#8221; 
every move, as though that were a surprise.</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning">&#9650;</span>
You can use a library routine called <code>Locale</code> to perform 
object listing. See <a href="sa3.html">&#167;A3</a> for details, 
but suffice to say here that the process above is equivalent to 
executing</p>

<p class="lynxonly"></p>
<pre class="code">
if (Locale(location, &quot;You can see&quot;, &quot;You can also see&quot;))
    print &quot; here.^&quot;;
</pre>

<p class="aside"><code>Locale</code> is useful for describing areas 
of a room which are sub-divided off while remaining part of the same 
location, such as the stage of a theatre.</p>

As mentioned above, the library implements &#8220;superbrief&#8221; and 
&#8220;verbose&#8221; modes for room description (one always omits 
long room descriptions, the other never does). How can verbose mode 
automatically print room descriptions every turn? (Some of the later 
Infocom games did this.)</p>

<p class="aside"><span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b>

&#8216;Balances&#8217; often uses <code>short_name</code>, especially 
for the white cubes (whose names change) and lottery tickets (whose 
numbers are chosen by the player). &#8216;Adventureland&#8217; uses
<code>short_name</code> in simpler ways: see the bear and the bottle, 
for instance. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>The scroll class of &#8216;Balances&#8217; 
uses <code>invent</code>. &nbsp;
<span class="warning"><b>&#8226;</b></span>See the <code>ScottRoom</code>

obliged to write for machines with under 16K of free memory).</p>
